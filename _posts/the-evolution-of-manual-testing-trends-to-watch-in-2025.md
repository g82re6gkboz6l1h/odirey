## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing involves testers performing test cases without automated tools, mimicking user behavior to identify issues automation may miss. Despite automation's rise, manual testing is invaluable for assessing user experience, usability, and unexpected scenarios. Its role has transformed from simple bug hunting to strategic analysis, intuitive judgment, and scenario adaptability.

In 2025, manual testers face dual demands: maintaining traditional expertise and adapting to trends driven by AI tools.
