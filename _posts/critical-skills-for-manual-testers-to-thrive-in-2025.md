## Why Manual Testing is Indispensable in 2025

Amid the rise of automation, manual testing is pivotal for securing user-centric software. Its importance lies in:

1. **Human-Centric User Experience Analysis** - Automated scripts lack human intuition for evaluating usability, accessibility, and visual design.
2. **Exploratory Testing** - Manual testers identify edge cases and inconsistencies, which automation may overlook.
3. **Dynamic Application Coverage** - Complex workflows often demand manual evaluation.
4. **Security & Contextual Testing** - Critical industries like finance require manual testing alongside automation for accurate real-world alignment.
5. **Agile Collaboration** - Testers ensure effective communication and early bug detection within agile teams.

Integrated manual and automated testing foster innovation while delivering high-quality results.
