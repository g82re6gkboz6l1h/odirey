## Manual Testing: 2025 vs. Today

Manual testing remains vital in QA, but its focus is shifting. The current emphasis on identifying software bugs and usability flaws is expanding to include:

1. **AI and Automation Synergy:** Testers must understand automation tools like Selenium, Appium, or frameworks for enhanced collaboration.
2. **Complex Systems Testing:** Navigating data integrity and system integration challenges.
3. **Shift-Left Participation:** Engaging earlier in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for better requirement analysis.

Manual testers must bridge traditional skills with modern development methodologies to stay industry-relevant.
