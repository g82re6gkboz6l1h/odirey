## Why Manual Testing Matters in the Age of Automation

Automation accelerates processes such as regression testing and scalability. Yet manual testing complements automation by addressing:

### 1. **Human Insights for Edge Cases**
Manual testers possess creativity to uncover issues automation might miss, such as user interface (UI) anomalies or user experience (UX) flaws.

### 2. **Exploratory Testing Excellence**
Exploratory testing relies on human judgment to investigate software behavior, uncovering hidden defects that scripts can't predict.

### 3. **Complex Scenarios**
Real-world workflows demand manual testing, especially for layered complexities like global mobile payments or localized user access control.

Manual testing isn’t an outdated method—it thrives alongside automation, pushing boundaries that machines alone cannot reach.
