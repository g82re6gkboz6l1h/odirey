## What is Manual Testing and Why is It Crucial?

Manual testing involves executing test cases manually, requiring testers to simulate real user interactions. By manually navigating through interfaces, inputting values, and assessing functionality, testers can verify software responsiveness, usability, and alignment with business objectives. While automation excels at repetitive tasks, manual testing stands out in critical areas like UI consistency, subjective usability evaluations, and uncovering complex defects that automated tools often overlook.
