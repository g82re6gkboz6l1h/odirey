## Introduction: Understanding Manual Testing's Evolution

Manual testing has always offered a human touch to QA. Unlike automated scripts, manual testing leverages creativity, intuition, and adaptability to uncover usability flaws and edge cases. As automation tools like Zof AI dominate routine testing tasks, manual testing adapts to focus on exploratory techniques, user-centric testing, and error handling.

In 2025, advancements in hybrid testing methods—combining manual and automated approaches—will reflect manual testing's undiminished value in increasingly complex tech ecosystems.
