## Why Manual Testing Remains Crucial in QA

Automation has revolutionized QA, but manual testing complements it by focusing on areas that scripts can't cover. Here's why manual testing still matters:

1. **Human Intuition**: Testers identify usability flaws and nuanced issues no script can detect.
2. **Exploratory Testing Excellence**: Manual testers uncover bugs by creatively exploring new scenarios.
3. **Complex Situation Handling**: They're invaluable for testing variable-heavy and integrated systems.
4. **Empathy for Users**: Manual testers ensure software aligns with end-user needs and perspectives.

Despite automation's dominance, manual testing focuses deeply on user satisfaction and adaptability, making it indispensable.
