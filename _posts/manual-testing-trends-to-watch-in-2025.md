## What is Manual Testing, and Why Does It Matter Today?

Manual testing goes beyond point-and-click procedures. It encapsulates a deep understanding of user expectations, scrutinizing edge cases, and testing scenarios automation scripts may overlook. From usability and exploratory testing to accessibility validation, manual testing ensures optimal user experiences—especially in dynamic interfaces like AR/VR and voice recognition systems. 

Even with AI and automation reshaping the tech space, no machine can truly replicate human creativity or intuitive problem-solving. By 2025, **QA testers** are expected to adopt smarter methodologies, aligning with Agile and DevOps processes while embracing AI-powered tools for enhanced productivity.
