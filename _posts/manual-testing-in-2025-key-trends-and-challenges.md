## The Role of Manual Testing: Beyond Automation
Manual testing is when human testers run test cases without automation. Even with the dominance of automated testing, manual testing retains its significance, especially in areas that require:

- **User Experience (UX) and Empathy:** Analyzing human reactions and behaviors.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Identifying unknown issues without defined scripts.
- **Visual and Usability Checks:** Ensuring aesthetic satisfaction and ease of navigation.
