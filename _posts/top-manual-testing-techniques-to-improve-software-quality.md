Exploring Widely-Used Manual Testing Techniques

### 1. Functional Testing
**Functional testing** evaluates whether software features function correctly according to requirements. By focusing on individual parts and validating inputs/outputs, testers ensure a seamless user experience. **Benefits:**

1. **Enhanced User Satisfaction:** Validating core functionalities builds trust and usability.
2. **Bug Prevention:** Early identification of flaws minimizes risks.
3. **Legal Compliance:** Ensures alignment with industry standards.

### 2. Regression Testing
**Regression testing** ensures modifications, updates, or patches do not disrupt existing functionalities. Its manual execution uncovers overlooked edge cases, providing adaptability for dynamic systems.

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive re-testing ensures system stability.
- Focused validation of hotfixes prevents cascading issues.
- Human oversight identifies user-centric complications before deployment.

### 3. Exploratory Testing
Contrary to structured methods, **exploratory testing** thrives on spontaneity and skill. Testers actively interact with the application, investigating potential vulnerabilities and inconsistencies.

**Benefits:**
1. **Fast Bug Detection:** Dynamic workflows uncover defects efficiently.
2. **Improved UX:** Real-time analysis reveals usability flaws impacting users.
3. **Adaptability:** Ideal for agile development or limited documentation phases.
