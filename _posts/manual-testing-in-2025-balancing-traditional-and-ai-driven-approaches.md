## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in 2025

AI and automation have transformed the testing process, especially for repetitive tasks and large-scale projects. However, certain elements of software testing demand a human perspective:

1. **Intuition and User Empathy**: Unlike AI, humans can gauge user emotions and interface usability for real-world scenarios.
2. **Identifying Edge Cases**: Manual testers have creativity and adaptability to catch bugs that AI algorithms may overlook.
3. **Exploratory Testing**: Spontaneous and unscripted interactions by manual testers often identify hidden software flaws.
4. **Contextual Testing**: Evaluating subtle glitches tied to business logic and user expectations still requires human insight.

A balanced approach ensures that the unique strengths of manual testing complement AI-driven efficiency.
