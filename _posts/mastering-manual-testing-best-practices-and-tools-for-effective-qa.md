## Importance of Manual Testing in QA

### **1. Human Insight on UX and Design**  
Only manual testing provides subjective feedback on design intuitiveness and user experience, a vital input for user-centric development.

### **2. Exploratory Testing Unleashed**  
Dynamic exploratory testing thrives in manual setups, discovering bugs beyond pre-scripted automation capabilities.

### **3. Accessibility for Non-Technical Teams**  
Manual testing’s low learning curve allows fast deployment, particularly for smaller teams without automation expertise.

### **4. Adaptable for Minor Updates**  
Ideal for evaluating small changes in agile workflows, manual testing ensures minimal delays without extensive script creation.

### **5. Superior for Specialized Testing**  
Tasks such as usability, localization, or ad-hoc testing demand human empathy and judgment only available in manual efforts.
