## The Influence of Advanced Technologies on Manual Testing

Emerging technology trends are reinventing both automation and manual testing. Here’s how these innovations integrate into manual QA processes:

### 1. **AI and ML**
AI-powered tools revolutionize testing with predictive analytics and dynamic test designs. Testers validate ML-driven decision-making systems for ethical use and precision, as AI systems often contain biases that human testers must catch.

### 2. **Blockchain**
Manual testers assess critical blockchain factors like consensus algorithms, wallet integration, and transaction verification using domain knowledge that automation struggles to replicate.

### 3. **IoT Devices**
Human testers are vital to evaluating real-world usability in IoT environments where testing spans across interconnected devices and unpredictable user engagement scenarios.

### 4. **AR/VR**
The experiential nature of AR/VR applications demands hand-on usability assessments to ensure intuitive design and seamless interaction, an area where manual testing triumphs.
