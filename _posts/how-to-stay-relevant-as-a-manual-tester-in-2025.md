## Why Manual Testing Matters

Manual testing excels in unique areas that automation cannot fully address, highlighting its continued significance:

1. **Human-Centric Applications**: Empathy, intuition, and human judgment are crucial in exploratory and usability testing, areas where automation falls short. For aspects like user emotions or intuitive design, manual testers provide unparalleled insights.

2. **Adapting to Frequent Changes**: Agile environments demand swift adaptation. Manual testers can quickly align strategies to continuously evolving requirements, bridging gaps left by automation.

3. **Catching Edge Cases**: Manual testers uncover unexpected errors and edge cases that automation might overlook, ensuring optimal functionality and user satisfaction.
