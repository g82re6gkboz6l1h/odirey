## State of Manual Testing in 2025

Despite automation advances, manual testing is indispensable in evaluating scenarios that automated scripts cannot handle. Manual testing excels in areas like complex UX workflows, exploratory testing, ad-hoc scenarios, and subjective human judgment. Sectors like healthcare, gaming, and finance benefit significantly from manual testers collaborating with automated systems to provide a seamless testing approach.

AI tools like **[Zof AI](https://zof.ai)** assist manual testers in making faster, more accurate decisions. These tools highlight high-risk areas, propose test scenarios, and analyze results effectively. However, testers face the challenge of adapting to hybrid roles, combining technical expertise with sharp analytical skills.
