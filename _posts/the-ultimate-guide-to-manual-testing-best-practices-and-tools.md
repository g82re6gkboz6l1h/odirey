## What is Manual Testing and Why It Still Matters?

**Manual Testing** requires a hands-on approach where testers simulate end users to ensure software operates correctly without relying on automation. But why stick to manual testing when automation is on the rise?

### Key Benefits of Manual Testing

1. **Human Touch**: Detects functional and aesthetic issues that automation tools may miss.
2. **Effective for Dynamic or Unpredictable Scenarios**: Manual methods allow for flexible and critical thinking.
3. **Cost-Effective**: Ideal for smaller projects where automation isn't feasible.
4. **Adaptive**: Easier to apply and understand without extensive programming skills.
