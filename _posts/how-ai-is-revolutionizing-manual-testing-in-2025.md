## How AI Shapes Manual Testing's Future

### Modern AI Applications in Manual Testing
Traditional manual testing, dependent on human observation and repetitive processes, has its limitations. By leveraging AI tools, testers can automate repetitive tasks, streamline defect detection, and create faster, more reliable testing scenarios. AI assists in:

1. **Test Case Prioritization**: AI identifies high-risk areas and prioritizes test cases based on historical data.
2. **Defect Prediction**: AI-driven systems predict potential code vulnerabilities before they cause significant issues.
3. **Visual Regression Testing**: Automatically compare UI snapshots across versions, ensuring consistency.

Tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) enable testers to maintain creative freedom while achieving higher productivity.
