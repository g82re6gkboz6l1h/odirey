# The Future of Manual Testing: Trends and Best Practices for 2025

Manual testing remains a cornerstone of software development, even as automation gains dominance. By 2025, manual testing will undergo transformative changes powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), user-centric approaches, and hybrid testing methodologies. While automated testing excels in repetitive tasks, manual testing thrives on human insight, creativity, and the ability to replicate end-user behaviors.

## What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is the process of manually executing test cases to identify software defects. It enables testers to simulate user interaction, uncover UX inconsistencies, and evaluate accessibility standards. While automation focuses on speed and efficiency, manual testing addresses qualitative aspects of software that require human intuition.
