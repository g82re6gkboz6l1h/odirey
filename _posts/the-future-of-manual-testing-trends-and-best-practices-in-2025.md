## Manual Testing in 2025: An Overview

While automation testing dominates conversation with its efficiency for repetitive tasks, manual testing is irreplaceable when it comes to edge cases, usability evaluations, and user experience (UX) validation. In 2025, manual testing thrives in exploratory testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and evaluating applications with accelerated feature releases.

Manual testers simulate human thought processes and real-world scenarios, ensuring a seamless user experience. However, as software spans diverse platforms like IoT, AR, VR, and blockchain, manual testing strategies must evolve to meet increased complexity and the need for quicker feedback cycles.
