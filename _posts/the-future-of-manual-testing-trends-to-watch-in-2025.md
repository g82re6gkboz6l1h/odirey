## Evolving Manual Testing Practices for 2025

**Manual testing** has long been a vital part of software quality assurance (QA), leveraging human creativity to assess functionality, usability, and performance. Although automation testing excels at repetitive tasks, manual testing ensures a critical, user-focused perspective on software applications. 

As businesses adopt **Agile** and **DevOps methodologies**, manual testing is moving earlier in the development lifecycle through **shift-left testing**, uncovering defects faster and improving long-term efficiency. Additionally, the versatility of manual testing now extends to evolving technologies like **AI applications**, **augmented reality (AR)** tools, and **IoT devices**—domains that demand nuanced judgment and exploration.

To thrive in this environment, QA testers must focus on:  
- **Enhancing domain expertise** to better understand intricate systems.  
- Developing **design thinking** skills to address usability concerns.  
- Integrating emerging tools for enhanced productivity.
