## What is Manual Testing's Role in an Era Dominated by AI?

With AI and automation disrupting industries worldwide, manual testing remains critical in capturing details and nuances machines might miss. For instance, automated tools often fail when tasked with assessing user interfaces' intuitiveness, emotional design, or rare edge cases. Manual testing excels because it incorporates the human element, ensuring rich user experiences and software quality. 

AI-powered tools like [Zof.AI](https://zof.ai) have enhanced various testing stages, automating repetitive tasks while producing detailed performance analyses. However, such tools require collaboration with manual testers to handle nuanced issues, emphasize empathy-driven design, and address human-centered use-case scenarios.
