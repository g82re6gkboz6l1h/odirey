## Why Tools Are Essential for Manual Testing

Manual testing is revered for its human-centered approach, which mimics real user experiences. Unlike automation, which thrives in repetitive and predefined scenarios, manual testing captures usability issues, design flaws, and subtle bugs.

That said, it can be labor-intensive and prone to human error. Modern testing tools are addressing these challenges by improving precision, efficiency, and insight. As we approach 2025, these tools are becoming critical for manual testers to stay competitive and deliver optimal results.
