## Key Manual Testing Techniques for 2025

Manual testing focuses on creativity, real-world usability, and detecting issues automation may miss. Here are key techniques that continue to thrive:

### 1. **Exploratory Testing**
Exploratory testing combines critical thinking and domain expertise to uncover unexpected issues using unscripted navigation. It is essential for user interface evaluations, usability assessments, and real-world user experience validation.

### 2. **Usability Testing**
Usability testing examines software intuitiveness, accessibility, and design coherence, ensuring applications cater effectively to diverse global audiences.

### 3. **Ad-hoc Testing**
Ad-hoc techniques, though unstructured, excel at discovering subtle issues in complex systems that automation may ignore, such as edge cases in unique user workflows.

### 4. **Regression Testing**
While commonly automated, regression testing benefits from human intervention to validate nuanced changes and dependencies in intricate systems.
