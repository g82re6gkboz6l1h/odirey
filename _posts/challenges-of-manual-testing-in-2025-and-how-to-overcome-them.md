## Challenges Applied to Everyday Testing

Below are specific struggles manual testers encounter:

### 1. **Processing Massive Data**
Modern systems handle larger data sets than ever before, creating challenges for manual testers managing performance, functionality, and usability checks across these datasets.

### 2. **Collaboration Gaps in Agile Environments**
Breaking silos in cross-functional teams can be difficult. Testers often find aligning with developers and automation engineers a significant barrier to efficient workflows.

### 3. **Frequent Requirement Changes**
Constantly shifting priorities and feature updates leave manual testers scrambling to keep up with new functionality or address existing bugs.

### 4. **Test Case Overload**
Diverse user scenarios and edge cases often lead to “test case explosion,” overwhelming testers and hampering productivity.

### 5. **Task Repetition and Burnout**
Repetitive tasks, such as regression testing, overload manual testers, reducing both enthusiasm and accuracy in output.
