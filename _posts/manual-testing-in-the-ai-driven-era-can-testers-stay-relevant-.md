## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in 2025
Despite the efficiency of AI-driven tools, manual testing remains vital for:

- **Exploratory Testing**: Analyzing edge cases and scenarios outside automation’s scope.
- **User-Centric Assessments**: Understanding user emotions and interactions for better UX/UI.
- **Adaptability**: Quick adjustments to shifting priorities in complex systems.
