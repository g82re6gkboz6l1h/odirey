## 1. Major Challenges Faced by Manual Testing Teams

Manual testing is renowned for its ability to uncover usability issues that automated tools may overlook. Yet, it is far from perfect. In 2025, manual testers are expected to face hurdles such as:

- **Time inefficiency:** Testing processes that require manual checks for numerous test cases are increasingly difficult to manage under short timelines.
- **Prone to human error:** Repetitive tasks under tight schedules can lead to oversight and inconsistencies.
- **Scalability issues:** As software systems grow, manual coverage becomes unmanageable with limited resources.
- **Overlooked edge cases:** Integrations and dependencies in advanced systems make detecting and replicating corner cases more challenging.
- **Skill gaps in new technologies:** Testing advanced applications often demands technical expertise beyond traditional manual testing methods.

While automation is progressing, manual testing remains vital, especially for usability and exploratory validation. Addressing these limitations is critical.

## 2. The Growing Influence of Automation on Manual Testing

Automation testing tools have revolutionized workflows by enabling speed and precision in repetitive tasks. As automation continues to rise in 2025, manual testers often face additional pressures:

- **Redefined roles:** Testers are expected to manage hybrid roles, adopting both manual and automated testing responsibilities.
- **Skill gaps:** Automation demands working knowledge of coding, scripting, and tool management, which some manual testers lack.
- **Resource allocation concerns:** Heavy investment in automation might sideline manual testing efforts.
- **Automation shortcomings:** Usability considerations and exploratory tests often go unaddressed, underscoring the need for manual intervention.

A unified approach that harmonizes manual and automation testing is key.
