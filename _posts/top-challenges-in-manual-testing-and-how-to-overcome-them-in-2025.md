## What’s Challenging Manual Testing in 2025?

Even with the rise of automation, manual testing faces specific challenges that demand innovative strategies:

### 1. **Increasing Complexity in Software Applications**
Modern apps, characterized by microservices, APIs, and dynamic interfaces, make identifying bugs and edge cases harder for manual testers.

### 2. **Time Pressure in Agile Development**
Manual testing often lags behind iterations in fast-paced Agile and DevOps environments, slowing project delivery.

### 3. **Human Error and Repetition Stress**
Fatigue from repetitive tasks during manual testing can lead to overlooked issues.

### 4. **Resistance to Automation Adoption**
Manual testers often view automation tools as disruptive or as threats to their roles.

### 5. **Lack of AI Skill Sets**
Staying competitive in 2025 requires manual testers to upskill, particularly in AI and automated functionalities.
