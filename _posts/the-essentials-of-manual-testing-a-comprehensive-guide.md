## Introduction to Manual Testing

**Manual Testing** is the hands-on approach where testers manually execute test cases, simulating the end user's experience. Unlike automated testing, where scripts run predefined steps, manual testing is all about human insight, adaptability, and precision.

### Key Benefits of Manual Testing
- **Unmatched Human Insight:** Detect usability issues and design flaws that automation might overlook.
- **Adaptability:** Perfect for exploratory testing where predefined scripts don't suffice.
- **Cost-Effective for Smaller Projects:** Avoid advanced setups and infrastructure for projects with limited scopes.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Immediate insights into user experience and issues during development.

Even with modern AI-driven tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), manual testing excels in areas where critical thinking and adaptability are required, retaining its importance alongside emerging technologies.
