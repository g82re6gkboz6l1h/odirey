## What is Manual Testing and Why is it Important?
Manual testing is the process of validating software manually—without automation tools—to identify bugs and ensure functionalities meet requirements. This type of testing is incredibly valuable for exploratory testing, user interface validation, and ad-hoc testing, as automation cannot cover every nuanced scenario. Beginners will benefit from learning manual testing to build skills in defect identification, test case creation, and requirement analysis.
