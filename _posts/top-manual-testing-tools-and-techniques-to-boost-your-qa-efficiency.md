## Why Do Tools Matter in Manual Testing?

Manual testing tools help testers simulate user behavior, identify gaps, and ensure usability. Without efficient tools, QA professionals may struggle to manage an already time-intensive process. Tools are critical in:

- **Streamlining Test Cases**: Centralized management of procedures makes execution seamless.
- **Bug Reporting and Tracking**: Organizing, documenting, and tracking bugs.
- **Empowering Team Collaboration**: Improving communication among QA, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Providing Key Metrics**: Robust report generation highlights progress and bottlenecks.
