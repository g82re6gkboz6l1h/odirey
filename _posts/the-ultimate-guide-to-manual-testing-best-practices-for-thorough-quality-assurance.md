## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing involves evaluating software applications manually, allowing testers to detect real-world issues such as usability flaws and edge-case scenarios that automated testing cannot. This hands-on approach is pivotal in exploratory, usability, and early-stage testing, where human insight is crucial.

## Why Manual Testing Is Crucial in Software Development

Automation is prevalent, but manual testing offers distinct advantages including:

- **Human Creativity**: Detecting usability and user experience issues automation can't replicate.
- **Complex Scenarios**: Visual and cultural nuances are best analyzed manually.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Allows testers to uncover unforeseen bugs and usability flaws.
- **Rapid Iterations**: Agile methodologies benefit from manual testing in adapting to changes.

Complement manual with automated testing for holistic QA strategies.
