## Revisiting Manual Testing Fundamentals in the Age of AI-Driven QA

Manual testing ensures software functions as intended, addressing subjective judgment, user behavior, and edge cases that AI might overlook. Despite the rise of AI-driven tools, manual testing remains crucial, especially for: 

1. **Subjective Testing:** Evaluating UI/UX designs and emotional user reactions. 
2. **Edge Case Identification:** Finding unpredictable bugs through creative thinking. 
3. **Validating AI Outputs:** Ensuring AI-produced outputs are accurate.
4. **Complementing Automation:** Focusing on areas like exploratory tests where automation falls short.

Manual testing isn't competing with automation; it's adapting to augment AI's capabilities.
