## **Why Manual Testing is Still Essential in 2025**

Manual testing underpins robust software quality assurance. While automation dominates in many areas, manual testing excels in specific contexts that demand human intuition, creativity, or direct user experience evaluation. Examples include assessing user interface aesthetics, identifying ambiguities, and testing complex scenarios beyond automated tool capabilities. 

The accelerated pace of agile and DevOps releases underscores the continued need for manual testing to complement automation. In 2025, manual testing is adapting and thriving rather than diminishing, proving to be an indispensable aspect of hybrid testing approaches.
