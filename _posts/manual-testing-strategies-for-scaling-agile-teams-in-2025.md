## The Evolution of Manual Testing in Agile Environments

Manual testing has evolved with agile workflows, focusing on usability validation and complex user scenarios where automation falls short.

### Shifting Manual Testing Left

Agile's "shift-left" testing philosophy integrates manual testers in requirement analysis and test-driven development (TDD), ensuring early detection of issues. By improving collaboration across roles, manual testing becomes integral to agile.
