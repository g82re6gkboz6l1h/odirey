## The Evolution of QA: AI's Influence
AI empowers testers by increasing efficiency, accuracy, and scope in QA processes. Machine learning can analyze vast datasets to pinpoint defects, while bots simulate real-world user behavior. Yet, AI does have its limitations, particularly in edge cases and when human intuition or empathy is required.

Key advantages of AI-powered QA include:
- Accelerated regression and functional testing.
- Predictive analytics highlighting vulnerable areas.
- Broad testing across multiple devices and setups.
- Cost efficiency by reducing manual, repetitive tasks.

Despite these achievements, AI cannot replace the nuanced evaluations needed in specific scenarios. Here lies the continued relevance of manual testing.
