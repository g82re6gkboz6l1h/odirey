## Key Techniques for the Future of Manual Testing

### 1. The Rise of Exploratory Testing  
Exploratory testing is invaluable in agile and DevOps frameworks. This unscripted approach taps into tester creativity and domain knowledge to uncover hidden defects often missed by automated tools. The growing complexity of software ecosystems highlights the need for flexibility and innovation — making exploratory testing an essential skill in your QA toolkit by 2025.

### 2. Usability Testing and the Human Factor  
Usability testing evaluates an application’s ease of use and alignment with user expectations. By focusing on personas, A/B testing, and engaging real-world user feedback, you can address pain points. As inclusivity and accessibility gain prominence, usability testing will remain pivotal in ensuring that software caters to diverse audiences.
