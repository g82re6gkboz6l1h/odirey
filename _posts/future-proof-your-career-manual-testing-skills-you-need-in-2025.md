## Why Manual Testing Still Holds Its Ground in 2025

Though automation excels at predefined scenarios, manual testing persists as an irreplaceable process in many areas:

1. **User Experience and Usability Testing**  
   Machines lack human emotions and empathy. Manual testers ensure software meets human standards for usability and design.

2. **Exploratory Testing**  
   Automated testing is script-driven, whereas manual testers uncover bugs through unscripted, dynamic testing.

3. **Handling Complexity**  
   AI tools struggle in fluid, unpredictable systems. Human testers adapt better to creative testing challenges.
