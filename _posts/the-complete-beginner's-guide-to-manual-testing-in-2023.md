## Manual Testing Explained: What You Need to Know in 2023

### What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing involves testers executing test cases manually without automated tools. It focuses on detecting bugs and usability issues from a user perspective. Automation complements this process but cannot fully replace the human touch required in exploratory tasks or UI/UX validation.

### Top Reasons Manual Testing Is Critical:
1. **Human Insight**: Identify user experience issues algorithms miss.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Adapt to unknown scenarios during development.
3. **UI/UX Validation**: Subjective evaluation of user satisfaction.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Low-budget solutions for startups and small projects.

Despite AI advancements, manual testing holds significant importance for delivering quality and usability in software projects.
