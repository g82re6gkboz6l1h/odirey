## The Role of Manual Testing in an AI-Driven Ecosystem

AI automation has introduced unparalleled efficiency in repetitive tasks and faster delivery cycles. However, manual testing holds its ground, excelling in critical areas like user experience (UX), interface consistency, and innovative exploratory testing. Human insight is essential for understanding the real-world behaviors of users, filling gaps that automated tools cannot. 

Skilled testers increasingly collaborate with AI, merging human intuition and creativity with machine efficiency. Manual testers are not just executors but strategic thinkers who enhance AI tools for robust results.
