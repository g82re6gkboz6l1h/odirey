## Introduction to the Evolution of Manual Testing

For decades, manual testing has been a backbone of quality assurance, executed by human testers to identify defects and evaluate functionality from a user’s perspective. Despite the surge in automation, manual testing continues to hold importance for tasks such as:

1. **Exploratory Testing**: Assessing software behavior without predefined rules.
2. **Usability Testing**: Capturing real human interactions and feedback.
3. **Unique Defect Detection**: Finding issues better identified by testers than algorithms.

However, as AI, machine learning, and accelerated development cycles become mainstream, manual testing is evolving alongside technologies. Advanced tools, collaboration platforms, and data-driven methodologies redefine the scope of manual testing, making adaptability essential.
