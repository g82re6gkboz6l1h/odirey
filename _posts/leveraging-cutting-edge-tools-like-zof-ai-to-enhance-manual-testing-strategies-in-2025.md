## Why Manual Testing Processes Require Transformation

The complexity of software development in 2025 has outgrown traditional methods of manual testing. Continuous development cycles, intricate user behaviors, and rising security concerns demand smarter solutions. Here’s why the shift is essential:

### Rising Development Speeds
Modern DevOps environments prioritize rapid code deployments, making traditional manual testing insufficient in addressing CI/CD demands.

### Complex User Expectations
Today’s users engage with multifaceted ecosystems; manual testers need tools to map these workflows.

### Enhanced Security Standards
Stringent compliance regulations mean testers must identify vulnerabilities more effectively than ever.
