## Manual vs Automated Testing: Key Differences Explained

Manual testing relies on human input and judgment, while automated testing leverages AI-powered tools for repetitive and large-scale tasks. Learn how these methods complement each other and fit unique scenarios like **exploratory testing**, **AI software validation**, and **continuous QA workflows**.

### Advantages of Manual Testing:
- Flexibility and adaptability for dynamic applications
- Human insights for intuitive design and usability flaws
- Ideal for instantaneous testing needs in tight timelines

### Benefits of Automated Testing:
- Speed and cost-effectiveness for large-scale regression tests
- Repeatability that ensures consistent test execution
- Scalability for complex systems requiring rapid feedback
