## Why Manual Testing Remains Relevant in an AI-Driven World

Automation tools enhance efficiency, but human testers bring creativity, intuition, and critical thinking to the table—qualities that no algorithm can replicate. Exploratory testing, user experience evaluation, and cross-device analysis rely heavily on human insight and adaptability. Manual testing ensures the software functions seamlessly in unanticipated real-world conditions, proving its importance as a complement to automated processes.
