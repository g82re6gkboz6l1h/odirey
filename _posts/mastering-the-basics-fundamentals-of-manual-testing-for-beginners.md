## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing involves a human tester manually executing test cases to identify defects or bugs in software. Unlike automated testing, it relies on human intuition and simulated end-user behavior to validate the software's functionality, usability, and compatibility.

### Common Types of Manual Testing:
1. **Exploratory Testing**: Dynamic exploration without predefined test cases.
2. **Functional Testing**: Verifies the functionality of specific features.
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensures new updates do not affect existing functionality.
4. **Integration Testing**: Checks how app modules work together.

## Why Manual Testing Matters

Manual testing remains indispensable due to its emphasis on human perspective and adaptability. Here’s why it’s still relevant:

### 1. **Human Intuition**
Manual testers can spot usability issues, graphical errors, and real-world problems that automated testing might miss.

### 2. **Cost-Efficiency**
Perfect for small projects or early-stage testing when investing in automation tools may not be practical.

### 3. **Coverage for Unscripted Scenarios**
Human testers can creatively venture into edge cases or unscripted workflows.

### 4. **Validation of Complex Interactions**
UI interfaces and dynamic elements often require manual intervention for proper testing.

Steps to Execute Manual Testing

For a seamless manual testing process, follow these clear steps:

### Step 1: **Understand Requirements**
Analyze user stories, acceptance criteria, and documentation to grasp the software’s expectations.

### Step 2: **Plan Testing Strategy**
Draft test plans with objectives, scope, and timelines.

### Step 3: **Develop Test Cases**
Craft detailed test cases outlining execution steps and expected outcomes. For example:
```plaintext
Test Case: Validate Login Feature
Steps:
1. Open Login Page.
2. Input valid credentials.
3. Click 'Login'.
Expected Outcome: Redirect to the dashboard.
```

### Step 4: **Execute Test Cases**
Compare real outcomes with expected ones, documenting discrepancies or bugs diligently.

### Step 5: **Report Defects**
Use clear descriptions, screenshots, or logs to report issues.

### Step 6: **Share Test Results**
Summarize tests conducted, success rates, and issues in a comprehensive report.

### Step 7: **Re-Test**
Verify fixes and ensure new updates haven't introduced fresh bugs.
