## Manual Testing Techniques Gaining Popularity in 2025

As automation gains momentum, manual testing thrives as it taps into human intuition for enhancing user experience. Discover advanced techniques making waves in 2025:

### 1. Exploratory Testing 2.0
Evolve from traditional exploratory approaches by integrating analytics to predict user actions, target weaknesses, and test creatively beyond scripted automation.

### 2. Context-Driven Testing
Tailor testing strategies to diverse environments and constraints, aligning processes with project-specific requirements for optimal coverage.

### 3. Session-Based Testing
Enhance productivity through time-boxed testing with defined objectives, ensuring detailed documentation and systematic results.

### 4. Risk-Based Testing
Prioritize critical functionalities, directing efforts to features ranked high-risk or user-impact focused.

### 5. Human-Centric Testing
Step into the user’s perspective, validating usability, accessibility, and satisfaction to ensure software aligns with emotional and experiential needs.

Mastering these techniques will help QA professionals tackle modern challenges and address critical gaps untouched by automation.
