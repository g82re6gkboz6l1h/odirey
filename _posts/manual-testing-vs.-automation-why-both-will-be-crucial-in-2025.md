## Manual Testing vs. Automation: Key Differences

Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases, providing subjective judgment, and uncovering usability issues. It's adaptable and excels at exploratory and usability testing, as well as analyzing human-centric features. Automation uses pre-written scripts and tools to execute test cases faster and more consistently, making it best suited for repetitive tasks and large-scale regression testing.

While automation excels at speed and efficiency, manual testing thrives in areas demanding creativity, empathy, and adaptability. Together, they create a balanced approach to software quality assurance.
