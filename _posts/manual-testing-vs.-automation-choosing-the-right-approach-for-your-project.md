## Manual Testing vs. Automation Testing: An Overview

**Manual Testing:** Performed by human testers, this approach is ideal for creative and exploratory tests, usability checks, and initial-stage projects where human intuition is critical.

**Automation Testing:** Powered by testing tools and scripts, automation excels at repetitive tasks, large-scale projects, regression testing, and performance assessments, offering speed and efficiency.

## Key Factors Affecting Your Choice

- **Project Scale:** Small projects benefit from manual testing, while automation is perfect for complex systems.
- **Budget:** Manual testing costs less upfront; automation requires tools and expertise.
- **Testing Type:** Manual suits exploratory and usability testing; automation handles regression and performance testing.
- **Deadlines:** Tight timelines favor automation; manual testing excels in detail-driven scenarios.
- **Update Frequency:** Regular updates call for an automation-focused strategy.
