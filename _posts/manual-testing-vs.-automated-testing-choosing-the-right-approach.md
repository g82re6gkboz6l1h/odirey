## What Is Manual and Automated Testing?

Before diving into their differences, let’s define these two approaches:

### Manual Testing
Manual testing is executed by human testers who interact with software to identify bugs and verify functionality. It’s a hands-on approach ideal for usability assessments and exploratory testing.

### Automated Testing
Automated testing uses tools and scripts to execute test cases without human intervention. Perfect for repetitive tasks, regression tests, and performance testing, automation prioritizes speed and scalability.

## Differences Between Manual and Automated Testing

| Feature                | Manual Testing                              | Automated Testing                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**          | Done by human testers in real-time.         | Scripts run tests automatically.           |
| **Time Efficiency**    | Slower for repetitive tasks.                | Rapid execution for bulk tests.            |
| **Cost**               | Minimal upfront expense.                    | Higher initial outlay; cost-efficient long-term. |
| **Scope**              | Adaptable to edge cases and unique scenarios. | Focused on predictable, repeatable tests.  |
| **Precision**          | Subject to human error.                     | Consistently accurate.                     |

Pros and Cons of Manual Testing

### Pros
1. **Versatility**: Adapts well to dynamic and exploratory scenarios.
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Critical for UI/UX and usability assessments.
3. **Low Investment**: Minimal setup costs compared to automation tools.

### Cons
1. **Time Consumption**: Repetitive testing can be slow.
2. **Human Error**: Mistakes may occur due to fatigue or oversight.

When to Choose Manual Testing
Consider manual testing for:
- **Usability Testing**: Human testers excel in subjective evaluations.
- **Short-Term Projects**: Efficient for projects with limited scope.
- **Dynamic Changes**: Suitable for evolving requirements.
