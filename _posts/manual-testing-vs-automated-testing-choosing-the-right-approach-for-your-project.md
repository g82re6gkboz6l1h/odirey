## Introduction: Understanding Manual and Automated Testing

Testing forms the bedrock to detect bugs and ensure software stability. Explore the core processes, benefits, and challenges of manual and automated testing. 

### Manual Testing
Manual testing uses human cognition to verify features and functionality. It shines in areas demanding creativity, user experience assessments, and exploratory evaluations.

### Automated Testing
Automated testing automates repetitive tasks using scripts and frameworks, excelling in scalability, regression testing, and handling vast datasets seamlessly. Tools like Selenium, Appium, and [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) elevate this process further.
