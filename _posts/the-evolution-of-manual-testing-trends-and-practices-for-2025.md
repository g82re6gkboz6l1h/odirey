## Manual Testing vs Automated Testing: The 2025 Perspective

Automation revolutionized testing, boosting speed and efficiency. Yet manual testing shines in complex scenarios requiring creativity, intuition, and real-world analysis. By 2025, manual testing complements automation, excelling in:

- **Exploratory Testing**: Detecting subtle, unforeseen bugs.
- **User Experience Testing**: Capturing usability insights automation may miss.
- **Visual Testing**: Identifying inconsistencies and aesthetic anomalies.

Expect hybrid strategies to dominate as testers utilize AI-powered workflows like **Zof AI** (https://zof.ai), merging manual expertise with automated efficiency. This synergy sets the future of software QA apart.
