## How Manual Testing Elevates Automation Processes

While automation accelerates test processes, manual testers bring irreplaceable value by evaluating usability, accessibility, and user-centric quality. Human testers delve into nuance, analyze edge cases, and ensure applications resonate deeply with end-users—all things machines struggle to contextualize. Manual testing is not competing with AI but collaborating to achieve comprehensive evaluations.
