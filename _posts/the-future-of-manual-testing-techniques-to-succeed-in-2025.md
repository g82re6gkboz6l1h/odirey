## Why Manual Testing is Still Essential

Although automation is becoming more advanced, manual testing remains indispensable for:

1. **Human-Centric UX/UI Testing**: Automated tools lack the intuitiveness needed to evaluate user experience and accessibility effectively.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Manual testers bring creativity and reasoning to explore unconventional test cases and edge scenarios.
3. **Complex and Dynamic Systems**: Adapting to rapid changes in Agile environments is easier with manual intervention.
4. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Manual testing validates diverse environments, platforms, and configurations that automation may miss.
5. **Complementary Role**: Automation accelerates repetitive tasks, while manual testers uncover intricate issues overlooked by scripts.
