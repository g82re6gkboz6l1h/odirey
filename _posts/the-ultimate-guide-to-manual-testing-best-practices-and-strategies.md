## Introduction to Manual Testing

Manual testing involves executing test cases without automation, relying on human insight to assess software functionality, usability, and performance. Testers simulate user interactions to identify defects and inconsistencies. This method is indispensable for exploratory scenarios where human judgment matters most.

### Objectives of Manual Testing:
1. Validating functional requirements.
2. Identifying bugs and crashes.
3. Ensuring cross-platform/device compatibility.
4. Improving user experience.

While resource-intensive, manual testing complements automation by addressing areas needing human creativity and precision.

Importance of Manual Testing in Software Development

Here’s why manual testing is crucial in today’s fast-paced SDLC:

### 1. **Enhancing User Experience**
Manual testing provides real-world insights into usability and navigation, offering unique feedback for developers and designers.

### 2. **Adapting to Changes**
Unlike automation, manual testing can swiftly validate evolving requirements without script adjustments.

### 3. **Effective Exploratory Testing**
Discover critical bugs and edge cases that automation might overlook through spontaneous exploratory testing.

### 4. **Necessary for Certain Applications**
Apps requiring human judgment, like gaming or UI tools, benefit greatly from manual insights.
