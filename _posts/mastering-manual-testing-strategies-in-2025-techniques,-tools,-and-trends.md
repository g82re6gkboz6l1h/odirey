Manual Testing & Modern Methodologies

### Integration into Agile Teams
Agile methodology ingrains testers in development cycles. By participating from ideation to deployment, testers contribute to continuous improvement of both software speed and quality.

### Continuous Testing in DevOps
In DevOps ecosystems, manual testers emphasize usability, exploratory testing, and monitoring, seamlessly complementing automation in delivering robust software.

### Shift Left, Shift Right
Early-stage testing (“Shift Left”) detects issues sooner, while “Shift Right” ensures ongoing quality post-launch. Both approaches highlight manual testers’ ability to prioritize real-user experiences.
