## What Is Manual Testing in 2025?

Manual testing is a process where testers manually execute and assess software functionalities without relying solely on automation. What sets manual testing apart is the human ability to think critically, apply creativity, and adapt dynamically—qualities that machines still struggle to replicate.

In 2025, manual testing has evolved into a blend of tradition and innovation. Tasks like exploratory testing, user experience validation, edge case analysis, and accessibility compliance rely on the human touch. While automation and AI take over repetitive or predictive tasks, manual testing ensures quality and usability where automation falls short. This synergy between humans and technology allows companies to deliver software faster while maintaining superior quality.
