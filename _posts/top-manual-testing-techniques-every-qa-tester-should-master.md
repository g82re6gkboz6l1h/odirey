## What Are Manual Testing Techniques?

Manual testing entails verifying software applications for defects without automation. Testers execute cases manually, validating functionalities against expected outcomes. Techniques in manual testing enhance test coverage, identify subtle errors, and adapt to complex scenarios not addressable by automation tools.

### Key Traits:
- Human-driven processes to uncover nuanced issues.
- Focus on usability, user experience, and creative evaluation.
- Flexibility in testing dynamic scenarios overlooked by scripts.

Automation excels in repetitive tasks, but manual testing’s creativity ensures intuitive evaluation. Mastering these techniques ensures QA testers deliver thoroughly validated applications.

## Top Manual Testing Techniques QA Testers Must Master

Explore these manual testing strategies to uncover issues and validate software functionality:

### **1. Exploratory Testing**
Dynamic, unscripted testing where testers explore applications creatively to detect issues.

#### Key Benefits:
- Encourages critical thinking.
- Uncovers unpredictable defects.
- Effective alongside structured tests.

### **2. Boundary Value Analysis**
Tests edge cases of numeric and input boundaries, ensuring input validation accuracy.

#### Example:
For input fields accepting 1-100, evaluate:
- Boundary edges (1, 100).
- Values inside limits.
- Slightly outside limits (0, 101).

#### Benefits:
- Pinpoints issues with validation.
- Ideal for applications with precise data requirements.

### **3. Equivalence Partitioning**
Simplifies test cases by dividing data into groups, testing representative values.

#### Example:
For values 1-100, test ranges:
- (1-50)
- (51-100)

#### Benefits:
- Reduces redundant tests.
- Balances coverage and efficiency.

### **4. Usability Testing**
Evaluates user experience, assessing design intuitiveness and user workflows.

#### Areas to Assess:
- Interface logic.
- Navigation ease.
- Clarity of alerts/error messages.

#### Benefits:
- Highlights UX bottlenecks.
- Enhances customer satisfaction.

### **5. Ad-Hoc Testing**
Informal testing, emphasizing spontaneity over documentation.

#### Benefits:
- Finds unexpected bugs.
- Ideal for fast assessments.
