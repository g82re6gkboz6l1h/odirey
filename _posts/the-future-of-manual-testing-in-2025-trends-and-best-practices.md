## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in 2025

Manual testing is indispensable for assessing user experience and identifying bugs that automated systems might miss. It plays a critical role in:

- **Usability Testing:** Determining software’s intuitiveness and user-friendliness.
- **UX Validation:** Evaluating visual and functional user interfaces.
- **Edge Case Analysis:** Testing unpredictable user behaviors.
- **Human-Centric Insights:** Offering comprehensive feedback on user interaction.

As automated frameworks improve, manual testing complements them by addressing areas where human expertise outshines. However, adapting to new tools, such as AI-powered testing platforms, will be vital for QA professionals.
