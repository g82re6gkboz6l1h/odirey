## Why Manual Testing Matters in an Automated World

Automation, powered by AI, efficiently detects many defects but struggles with subjective analysis like usability, aesthetics, or unpredictable scenarios. Manual testing bridges this gap, excelling at:

- **User Experience Reviews**: Spotting UI/UX inconsistencies and usability issues.
- **Ad-hoc Testing**: Reacting dynamically to unique, unforeseen scenarios.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Discovering edge cases beyond predefined scripts.
- **High-context Insight**: Applying human judgment, domain expertise, and environmental considerations.

Despite the reliance on AI-driven automation, manual testing remains vital for robust, user-centric software.
