## The Evolution of Manual Testing

Manual testing, defined by its reliance on human intuition and analytical thinking, stands as a counterbalance to automation’s algorithmic approach. Through its history, manual testing has undergone three major phases:

1. **1990s–2000s (Manual Era)**: Testing relied heavily on human effort using simple spreadsheets and basic tools.
2. **2010s (Automation Boom)**: Automation tools surged, increasing testing speed but leaving room for manual assessment of UX and usability.
3. **2020s (Blended Approach)**: A hybrid model emerged, incorporating AI-powered tools into manual testing for enhanced efficiency and deeper insights.

Looking forward to 2025, manual testing will continue to adapt, focusing on creative, user-centric assessments for high-tech fields ranging from IoT and wearables to augmented and virtual reality.
