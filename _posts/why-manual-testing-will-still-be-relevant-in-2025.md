## Debunking the Myth of Manual Testing’s Decline

Many believe that manual testing is becoming obsolete due to widespread adoption of automation tools. However, automation has limitations that only manual testing can overcome:

- **Contextual Understanding:** Human testers evaluate nuanced scenarios and subjective experiences, which automated tools struggle with.
- **Dynamic Environments:** Manual testers adapt to unpredictable testing conditions and edge cases better than rigid automation scripts.
- **High Maintenance Requirements:** Updating automation scripts as software evolves can be time-consuming, whereas human testers adapt more efficiently.

Rather than disappearing, manual testing is transforming, leveraging AI-powered tools to boost efficiency and productivity.
