## Why Manual Testing Matters for Beginners

Manual testing involves hands-on evaluation of software to ensure functionality, usability, and quality. Unlike automated testing, it replicates real-user interactions, uncovering bugs and usability issues more effectively.

### Key Benefits:
- Provides a human perspective for better usability.
- Serves as a stepping stone to understand testing fundamentals.
- Ideal for exploratory and usability testing scenarios.
