Deciding Between Manual Testing and AI Automation

The combination of AI and manual testing works exceptionally well, but knowing when to rely on each approach is critical:

**When to Use AI Automation:**

- **High repetition tasks** like regression and performance testing.
- **Complex datasets** that require multiple iterations.
- **Tight deadlines**, enabling faster workflows.

**When to Emphasize Manual Testing:**

- **Exploratory testing**, requiring intuition for user scenario exploration.
- **User experience evaluation**, needing emotional and usability assessments.
- **New feature development**, where no historical AI data exists yet.
