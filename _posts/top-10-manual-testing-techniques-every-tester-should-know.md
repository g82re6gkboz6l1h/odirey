## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing involves testers executing test cases manually, without automation tools, to identify software bugs. By stepping into the user’s shoes, testers ensure applications work as designed, delivering exceptional user experiences. Unlike automated testing, manual testing is exploratory and creative, often uncovering issues automation might miss.

## Top 10 Manual Testing Techniques for Testers

Below are essential manual testing techniques for every QA professional:

### 1. **Black Box Testing**
Focuses on input/output validation without viewing the code. Best for functional and user interface testing.
- **Use Case**: Validating an online payment gateway.

### 2. **White Box Testing**
Involves evaluating the internal code and logic. Ideal for code validation and security checks.
- **Use Case**: Testing loops and statements within a banking application.

### 3. **Exploratory Testing**
An unscripted approach driven by tester creativity. Great for discovering unique edge cases.
- **Use Case**: Testing video game user interactions.

### 4. **Ad-Hoc Testing**
Informal testing conducted without documentation, based on tester expertise.
- **Use Case**: Quickly identifying glitches in an app prototype.

### 5. **Boundary Value Analysis**
Tests software behavior at input boundary extremes, such as minimum/maximum values.
- **Use Case**: Testing login password length restrictions.

### 6. **Equivalence Partitioning**
Divides input into equivalent partitions to reduce redundant test cases.
- **Use Case**: Verifying valid and invalid credit card formats.

### 7. **Negative Testing**
Focuses on handling invalid inputs to ensure error resilience.
- **Use Case**: Testing text input in fields that should accept only numbers.

### 8. **Regression Testing**
Ensures updates or bug fixes don’t break existing functionality.
- **Use Case**: Verifying impacted areas post-software patch deployment.

### 9. **Usability Testing**
Evaluates application design, ease of use, and overall user experience.
- **Use Case**: Testing mobile app navigation and design feedback.

### 10. **Performance Testing**
Manually identifying system bottlenecks during key tasks.
- **Use Case**: Testing basic app loading times with minimal resources.

Where Manual Testing Excels

Manual testing shines in areas unfit for automation:
1. **Human Intuition**: Testers catch nuanced bugs machines overlook.
2. **Exploration**: Creative testing generates unique case insights.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Resource-friendly for smaller projects.
4. **User-Centric Testing**: Gauges UX and emotional responses automation can’t detect.
5. **Rapid Feedback**: Can be implemented early in a project before scripting automation.
