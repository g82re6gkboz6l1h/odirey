## The Role of Manual Testing in 2025

Manual testing involves assessing software functionality by human testers, evaluating edge cases, and understanding user behavior. Unlike automated testing, manual testing emphasizes creativity and flexibility, which remain critical for identifying bugs and usability issues that machines might miss. 

While automation tools are essential for repetitive tasks, manual testing is indispensable for:

- **User experience (UX)**: Evaluating how users interact with applications.
- **Exploratory testing**: Discovering hidden flaws or innovative use cases.
- **Creativity-driven scenarios**: Tackling non-scripted, human-centered tests.

Rather than becoming obsolete, manual testing in 2025 will embrace new tools and methodologies for greater relevance and impact.
