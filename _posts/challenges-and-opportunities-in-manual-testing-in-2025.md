## The Changing QA Landscape: Automation and AI in Testing

Over the past decade, QA processes have shifted drastically, prioritizing automation in DevOps pipelines over traditional manual testing. This transformation is accelerated by AI-powered testing platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), redefining scalable, efficient testing practices. Traditional manual testing—based on step-by-step test case execution—has evolved into a more dynamic role where testers contribute to quality planning, critical analysis, and integrating test automation.

Despite automation's prominence, manual testing still plays a vital role in areas requiring human judgment, such as usability testing and assessing complex system behaviors. Manual testers must adapt by addressing challenges head-on and leveraging emerging opportunities.
