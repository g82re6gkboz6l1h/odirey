## Why Manual Testing Remains Irreplaceable

### 1. **Human-Centric Approach**
Machines can replicate data-driven tasks, but manual testers bridge the gap with empathy, intuition, and subjective evaluation.

### 2. **Adaptability in Agile**
Agile teams frequently deal with evolving requirements. Manual testing adapts easily to these rapid changes by allowing testers to explore new features as they’re developed.

### 3. **Exploratory Testing**
Automated scripts can't predict the unpredictable. Exploratory testing thrives on creativity to ensure applications perform across diverse scenarios.
