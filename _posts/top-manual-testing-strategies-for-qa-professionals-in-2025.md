## Manual Testing Aligned with Agile and DevOps

Agile and DevOps workflows demand faster collaboration and adaptability. Here are critical manual testing strategies tailored for QA professionals working in these environments:

### 1. Targeted Testing with User Stories
QA testers verify user stories for functionality, usability, and edge cases, ensuring feature fulfillment and usability beyond automated checks.

### 2. Real-Time Feedback in CI/CD Pipelines
Manual testers enhance collaboration within Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems by delivering immediate feedback during development builds.

### 3. Shift-Left Testing for Early Issue Identification
QA teams engage at the early development stages, enabling proactive issue resolution before they escalate into critical defects.

### 4. Testing in Production-Like Environments
Simulating real-world conditions in pre-production environments ensures the highest software reliability before deployment.

Agile-friendly testing tools like **Zof AI** (https://zof.ai) streamline test orchestration and allow QA teams to scale their manual testing efforts alongside automation practices for impactful results.
