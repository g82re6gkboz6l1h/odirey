## Manual Testing Challenges in 2025

The growing complexity of software applications and accelerated development cycles present enormous pressure on manual testing. The major challenges include:

1. **Expanded Test Coverage**  
   Applications now span multiple platforms, APIs, and complex systems, requiring comprehensive yet time-consuming test coverage.

2. **Tight Agile Deadlines**  
   Agile and DevOps prioritize faster releases, leaving less room for thorough manual testing within rapid cycles.

3. **Resource Constraints**  
   With limited QA resources, teams are expected to manage larger workloads efficiently.

4. **Burnout and Errors**  
   Repetitive tasks like regression testing contribute to fatigue and the risk of human error in manual testing.

5. **The Surge of Automation**  
   Automation tools are reshaping the QA landscape, challenging manual testers to prove their unique value.
