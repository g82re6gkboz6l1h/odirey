## What is Manual Testing & Why Is It Important?

Manual testing involves executing test cases without automation tools to detect software defects. It’s vital in software quality assurance because it ensures:

- **Real-World Verification**: Simulates actual user behavior to uncover usability issues.
- **Adaptability**: Quickly accommodates evolving requirements and testing scenarios.
- **Human Insights**: Addresses usability, design issues, and user experience concerns.
- **Foundation for Automation**: Prepares fundamentals before integrating automated testing solutions.

## Manual Testing vs Automation Testing: Key Differences

| **Criteria**        | **Manual Testing**       | **Automation Testing**       |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Execution Speed** | Slower (human-dependent) | Faster (script-based tools)  |
| **Tools Needed**    | None                     | Tools like Selenium, TestNG  |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Cost-effective initially| Higher initial expenses      |
| **Adaptability**    | Highly adaptable         | Requires script updates      |
| **Best Used For**   | Usability/Exploratory    | Regression/Performance tests |

Both methods complement each other and require testing professionals to understand their unique use cases.
