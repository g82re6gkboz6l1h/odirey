## Why Manual Testing is Still Crucial

Even as automation grows, manual testing holds its value:

- **Human Intuition**: Manual testers examine user behavior, UX design, and unexpected scenarios that no AI can replicate.
- **Critical Bug Detection**: Usability issues and application flaws are swiftly identified via manual efforts.
- **Synergy with Automation**: While testing scripts address repetitive tasks and regression testing, manual methods excel in exploratory and dynamic scenarios.

As customer satisfaction shapes demand for flawless software, manual testers remain essential in QA processes.
