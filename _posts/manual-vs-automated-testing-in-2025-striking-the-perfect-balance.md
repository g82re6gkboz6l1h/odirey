## Why Manual Testing is Indispensable
Manual testing thrives in the AI era by leveraging: 
- Human intuition to ensure user satisfaction.
- Exploratory testing for uncovering unexpected nuances.
- Scenario-specific validation for real-time interactions.
- Addressing AI limitations in subjective tasks like cultural sensitivity and ethical compliance.
Despite its challenges, manual testing offers a human touch that complements automation.
