## Current Challenges in Manual Testing

Manual testing is indispensable yet faces its share of challenges due to evolving software and market demands:

**1. Accelerated Development Cycles:** Agile and DevOps require shorter testing timelines, leading to potential oversights in quality assurance.

**2. Resource Constraints:** Over-reliance on automation often sidelines manual testing, undervaluing its crucial role in catching nuances automation might miss.

**3. Automation Bias:** Misconceptions about manual testing being outdated underestimate its importance in exploratory and usability testing.

**4. Increasing System Complexity:** AI, IoT, and other advanced systems challenge testers to develop deeper technical and domain expertise.

To thrive, manual testers must evolve by incorporating new tools and practices.
