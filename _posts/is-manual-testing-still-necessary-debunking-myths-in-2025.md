### Debunking Manual Testing Myths:
1. **Automation Is Perfect:** AI tools aren't error-free, and manual testing validates outputs.
2. **Manual Testing Is Obsolete:** Manual testing thrives in exploratory, localization, and usability domains.
3. **It’s Inefficient:** Manual testing often saves time by preventing costly fixes later.
4. **Automation Eliminates Jobs:** Human testers complement AI tools, focusing on strategic tasks.

### How Manual and Automated Testing Work Together:
Manual testing complements automation by:
- Focusing on **user perspective** and **experience.**
- Innovating during **feature explorations.**
- **Validating automation outputs** for accuracy.
- Adapting to **dynamic systems.**
- Enhancing **accessibility** and **localization.**
