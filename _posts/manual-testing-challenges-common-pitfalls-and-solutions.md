## Why Manual Testing Matters

### Unpacking the Strengths
Manual testing excels where human intuition is required, such as fine-tuning UI/UX and exploratory testing. Unlike automation, it captures complex defects and usability glitches that impact user satisfaction.
Yet, the process can be:

- Time-consuming
- Prone to human error
- Challenging for tasks requiring repetition

Balancing manual and automated testing is crucial for optimal results.
