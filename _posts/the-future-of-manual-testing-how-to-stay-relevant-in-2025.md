## The Changing Role of Manual Testing in 2025

Manual testing remains vital to software quality assurance, with its strength rooted in exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing. These areas highlight the irreplaceable value of human empathy and intuition. However, manual testing today is more integrated into agile workflows, where testers collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and designers from the outset of projects.

Hybrid models combining manual and automated testing are becoming the norm. This evolving landscape demands that manual testers enhance their skills to operate in integrated, technology-driven environments. Collaboration with automation engineers to leverage speed, precision, and human creativity is key to their success.
