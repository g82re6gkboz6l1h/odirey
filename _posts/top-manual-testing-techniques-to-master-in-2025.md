## Importance of Manual Testing Amid Automation Advancements

Automation handles repetitive tasks efficiently but can't replicate human intuition. Manual testing uncovers critical UX/UI issues, addresses edge cases, and ensures emotional resonance in high-stakes industries like healthcare and finance. Agile teams also rely on manual testing for reacting to frequent on-the-fly code changes. As software becomes more complex, manual testing remains foundational in quality assurance.
