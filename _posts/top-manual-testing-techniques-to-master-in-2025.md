## Advanced Manual Testing Techniques You Must Know

Manual testing is evolving into a more strategic and analytical process. Let’s explore some advanced techniques that will shape the manual QA segment in 2025.

### 1. **Exploratory Testing in Dynamic Scenarios**
Exploratory testing uncovers hard-to-detect issues beyond predefined test scripts. With the growth of IoT and interconnected systems, becoming adept at exploratory testing for real-world scenarios ensures adaptability in today’s fast-changing tech environments.

### 2. **Risk-Based Testing**
By 2025, risk-based manual testing will dominate due to its focus on high-risk application areas. This technique optimizes resource allocation, ensuring critical components and potential failure points are sufficiently tested, even in complex architectures.

### 3. **User-Centric Usability Testing**
An ever-expanding emphasis on user experience will drive demand for usability testing. Skilling up in this area ensures that interfaces are intuitive and user-friendly for global, diverse audiences. 

### 4. **Context-Driven Testing**
Context-driven testing adapts methods based on the unique needs of each project. This approach is particularly valuable for testing highly customized or niche systems where no single formula applies.
