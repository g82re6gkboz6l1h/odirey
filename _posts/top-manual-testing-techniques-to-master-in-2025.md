Uncover unexpected defects using creative, human-led processes that automation can't replicate.

### UX Testing
Evaluate usability and accessibility with subjective insights critical to user satisfaction.

### Ad-hoc Testing
Test intuitively without predefined scripts, ideal for identifying overlooked issues.

### Agile Development and Dynamic Requirements
Adapt manual methods for projects with frequent requirement changes.
