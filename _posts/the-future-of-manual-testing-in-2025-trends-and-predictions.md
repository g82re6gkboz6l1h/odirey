## The Evolution of Manual Testing

Manual testing has stood as the backbone of quality assurance (QA) since software development began. Unlike automation testing, it relies on human intuition and expertise to assess software behavior, functionality, and usability. The approach provides insights into user experience (UX) and creativity-driven edge cases that automation struggles to address.

Now adapted to Agile and DevOps workflows, manual testing seamlessly integrates into iterative releases and continuous delivery models. As the industry prioritizes faster deployments, demand for rigorous UX-focused and exploratory testing will grow, paving the way for a more refined manual testing strategy in 2025.
