## What Is Manual Testing and Why Is It Important?

Manual testing involves executing test cases without relying on automated tools. Testers simulate real-world user actions to identify potential software bugs, usability issues, and design flaws. It’s especially effective in areas like usability evaluation and exploratory testing. Here’s how the manual testing lifecycle generally works:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Gaining a thorough understanding of the project requirements.
2. **Test Planning:** Strategizing testing activities to be conducted.
3. **Test Case Development:** Crafting detailed test cases that outline testing procedures.
4. **Test Execution:** Manually running tests to validate functionalities.
5. **Bug Reporting:** Logging issues, including evidence, to ensure easy resolution.

Manual testing complements automation and remains essential for smaller projects, UX checks, and scenarios where human intuition matters.
