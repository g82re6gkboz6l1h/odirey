## Understanding Manual and Automated Testing

### What Is Manual Testing?
Manual testing relies on human testers to execute test cases, analyze results, and explore creative test scenarios. It thrives in areas requiring intuition and adaptability, such as user experience, usability, and complex workflows. 

### What Is Automated Testing?
Automated testing leverages software and tools to execute predefined test scripts, enhancing speed and precision for tasks like regression testing or large-scale validation.
