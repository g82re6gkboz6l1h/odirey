## Key Roles Manual Testers Play

### **Identifying Human-Centric Bugs:**
Manual testers find issues with UI/UX design, dynamic features, and usability that machines often miss.

### **Exploratory Testing:**
Through creative and unstructured approaches, testers uncover unique bugs not defined by scripts.

### **Automation Validation:**
Humans review automated test results, define criteria, and bridge test coverage gaps.

### **Agile Adaptability:**
Manual testing adapts to rapid development cycles and last-minute changes more flexibly than automation.

### **Real-World Simulations:**
Testers evaluate software on physical devices under authentic conditions, unveiling issues beyond pre-programmed scenarios.
