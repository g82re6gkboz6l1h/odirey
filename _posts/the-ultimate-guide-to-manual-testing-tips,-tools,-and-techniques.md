## What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing is a hands-on process where testers manually execute test cases to evaluate software for functionality, usability, and overall performance. Unlike automated testing, which relies on scripts and tools, manual testing requires human intelligence to detect subtle bugs and identify usability issues. It’s ideal for exploratory testing, quick tests, and scenarios where automation isn’t feasible.

## Manual vs. Automated Testing: Key Differences

Knowing when to choose manual or automated testing is crucial. Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature             | Manual Testing                            | Automated Testing                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Execution**       | Carried out by humans.                   | Performed by scripts/tools.              |
| **Speed**           | Slower process.                          | Faster for repetitive tests.             |
| **Accuracy**        | Prone to human error.                    | Higher precision.                        |
| **Cost**            | Lower upfront costs; fewer resources.    | Higher initial cost for setup.           |
| **Best Use Cases**  | Exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc tests.| Regression and repetitive scenarios.     |
