## Essential Techniques for Manual Testing in 2025

Learn the timeless yet modernized approaches that make manual testing indispensable:

### 1. **Exploratory Testing**
   An unscripted testing method that relies on testers' intuition to uncover hidden issues, undefined edge cases, and usability concerns. It leverages human experience to detect unforeseen problems.

### 2. **Boundary Value Analysis & Equivalence Partitioning**
   Focuses on testing app limits and input partitions to identify edge cases efficiently, ensuring comprehensive coverage with minimal redundancy.

### 3. **Usability Testing and Accessibility Compliance**
   Ensures software provides excellent user experience and meets accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.1, for inclusivity.

### 4. **Ad-hoc Testing**
   Relies on creative, unstructured methods by experienced testers to reveal vulnerabilities often missed by scripted tests.

### 5. **Regression Testing**
   Vital for ensuring updates and new features don’t dismantle existing functionalities, maintaining software stability.
