## Why Manual Testing is Crucial for QA

### 1. Enhancing User Interaction
Manual testing provides human insight, pinpointing usability issues automated tests often miss, like design flaws or inefficient workflows. This direct interaction ensures software feels intuitive for end-users.

### 2. Flexibility with Exploratory Testing
Exploratory testing thrives in manual processes, where testers experiment and uncover edge cases that predefined scripts may overlook.

### 3. Adapting to Dynamic Applications
For applications with frequent updates, manual testing verifies changes in real-time, ensuring smooth functionality post-deployment.

### 4. Real-Time Bug Reporting
Unlike automated tools with delayed bug logging, manual testers can identify and share contextual feedback immediately, accelerating the development process.

Combining manual and automated testing ensures robust QA coverage, blending human intuition with machine precision.
