## Manual vs. AI-Driven Testing: Key Differences

### Manual Testing: Human-Centric Approach
Manual testing is highly effective for exploratory testing, usability analysis, and scenarios requiring human reasoning. While flexible and intuitive, it struggles with repetitive tasks, scalability, and speed.

### AI-Driven Testing: Automation and Precision
AI-driven testing leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to handle vast datasets, automate test scripts, and predict defects. It excels in scalability and rapid execution but lacks human intuition for nuanced tests.
