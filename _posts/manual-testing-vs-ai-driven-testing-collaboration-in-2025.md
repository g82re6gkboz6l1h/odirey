## Why Manual Testing and AI Will Work Hand-in-Hand

Manual testing remains essential for user-centric aspects, such as UI evaluation and exploratory testing. In contrast, AI thrives in automating repetitive and large-scale regression testing. Together, these processes create a symbiotic relationship. AI tools analyze patterns and expose vulnerabilities, while human testers ensure the AI’s work aligns with business goals and user needs.
