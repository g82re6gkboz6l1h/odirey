## Why Manual Testing is the Foundation of QA

Manual testing involves human execution of test cases, offering vital insights into UI inconsistencies, usability issues, and unique edge cases. Its flexibility is pivotal during early development stages, where exploratory testing and user experience validation are crucial. Complex scenarios requiring creativity further highlight its importance.

## Manual Testing vs Automated Testing: A Comparison

Explore the distinctions:

| Aspect                 | Manual Testing                           | Automated Testing                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Time and Effort        | Time-intensive step-by-step scenarios.  | Fast for repetitive, large-scale tasks.      |
| Accuracy               | Prone to human error.                   | Precise and consistent for predefined scripts.|
| Flexibility            | Ideal for dynamic scenarios.            | Suited for repetitive and predictable testing.|
| Cost Efficiency        | Cheaper for small-scale projects.       | Long-term savings despite upfront costs.     |
| Scope of Testing       | Perfect for exploratory and usability testing. | Best for regression and performance testing. |

Both methods complement rather than compete, emphasizing the need for integration.
