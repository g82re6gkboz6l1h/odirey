## Manual Testing and Agile/DevOps Evolution

Evolving methodologies like Agile and DevOps have profoundly transformed manual testers' roles. Once isolated to post-development stages, manual testers are now engaged throughout the development lifecycle, from sprint planning to deployment.

### Key Adjustments for Manual Testing Success:

1. **Shift-Left Testing for Early Debugging:** Testers collaborate with developers during early development stages to foresee and mitigate potential issues.
   
2. **Emphasis on Exploratory Testing:** Manual testers excel where automation falters—discovering usability flaws and exploring unique edge cases through creativity.
   
3. **Cross-Function Collaboration:** DevOps has blurred lines between QA and development teams. Manual testers work alongside developers, enhancing automated pipelines while contributing unique human perspectives.
   
4. **Continuous Integration (CI) Support:** Manual testers aid developers by reviewing unit and functional tests, reducing knowledge silos.
