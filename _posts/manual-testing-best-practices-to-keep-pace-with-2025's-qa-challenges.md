## Key Manual Testing Practices for 2025 Success

Manual testing will thrive with these best practices:

1. **Risk-Based Testing**
   - Focus efforts on high-risk app areas managing user data or traffic, ensuring adequate manual validations.

2. **Exploratory Testing**
   - Emphasize dynamic, behavior-based testing to uncover usability flaws or edge cases automation might miss.

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Ensure seamless functionality across smartphones, IoT devices, wearables, and embedded systems.

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - Keep up with emerging testing technologies and methodologies to maintain relevance.

5. **Enhanced User Experience Focus**
   - Assess navigation, accessibility, and aesthetics from the user viewpoint to create intuitive systems.
