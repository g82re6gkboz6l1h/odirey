## Key Manual Testing Challenges in 2025

### 1. **Time-Intensive Processes**
Manual testing is time-draining due to repetitive tasks and meticulous documentation, delaying time-to-market schedules.

### 2. **Human Error Risks**
Error-prone manual testing means bugs are often overlooked, leading to unreliable results and undetected issues.

### 3. **Resource Constraints**
Small QA teams face mounting workloads, particularly in projects with large codebases and complex functions.

### 4. **Regression Testing Overload**
Frequent updates necessitate continuous regression testing, straining timelines if done manually.

### 5. **Limited Coverage**
Constrained resources force teams to select specific functionalities to test, leaving others potentially vulnerable.

### 6. **Misaligned Communication**
Manual testing sometimes lacks integration with development workflows, creating gaps between QA, developers, and managers.
