## What is Agile Testing?

Agile testing integrates testing as a continuous process within Agile development cycles. Rather than being a separate phase, it occurs concurrently with development to deliver rapid, adaptive, and quality results.

### Key Agile Testing Principles:

1. **Continuous Testing:** Proactive defect detection during development.
2. **Collaboration:** Close inter-disciplinary communication.
3. **Automation & Manual Testing Balance:** Using both effectively.
4. **Feedback Integration:** Timely responses for development alignment.

## Why Manual Testing Matters in Agile Teams

Though automation is growing, manual testing remains critical for scenarios requiring subjective judgment, exploratory methods, and usability assessments.

### Best Uses for Manual Testing:

- **Exploratory Testing:** Discover edge cases and usability insights.
- **UI/UX Validation:** Evaluate user experience manually.
- **Ad-hoc Testing:** Adapt quickly to evolving requirements.
- **Smoke Testing:** Validate key functionalities before detailed tests.
