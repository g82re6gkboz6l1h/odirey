## Manual Testing in 2025: Why It Matters

Despite the automation revolution, manual testing remains essential to testing workflows. Here’s why:

### 1. **Human Validation**
Automated tools verify functions, but only human testers can simulate authentic user interactions and identify UI/UX issues.

### 2. **Exploratory Testing**
Unscripted, creative testing by humans often uncovers unexpected edge cases that automation cannot predict.

### 3. **Testing Dynamic Scenarios**
Manual testing is indispensable for assessing new features, unanticipated use cases, and unscripted behavior.

### 4. **Collaborative Development**
Testers’ input boosts UX/UI quality and aligns teams under DevOps and Agile structures.

### 5. **Automation Collaboration**
Automation relies on initial manual test creation, ensuring symbiotic collaboration between tools and testers.
