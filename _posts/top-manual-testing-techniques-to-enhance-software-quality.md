## The Role of Manual Testing in Software QA

Manual testing involves executing test cases by hand, simulating end-user behaviors to detect bugs, inconsistencies, and usability concerns. With techniques tailored to project-specific requirements, manual testing complements automation by offering a human perspective crucial for quality assurance.

### Key Manual Testing Techniques

- **Exploratory Testing**: Encourages non-linear thinking to uncover edge cases.
- **Ad Hoc Testing**: Testers attempt to ‘break’ the system without predefined plans.
- **Usability Testing**: Verifies user-friendliness and accessibility.
- **UI Testing**: Ensures interface aesthetics meet user expectations.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifies updates don’t compromise existing functionality.

Each method ensures holistic testing to minimize flaws and enhance user experience.
