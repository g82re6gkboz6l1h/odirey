## Why Manual Testing Still Matters

Although automation accelerates repetitive tasks, manual testing excels in scenarios requiring human judgment, empathy, and creativity. Testers don’t just validate software—they ensure UX flows naturally, addressing edge cases machines often overlook.

However, automation tools, CI/CD pipelines, and AI present new opportunities for testers. By 2025, manual testers won't aim to compete with automation but complement it, leveraging empathy for end-users while adopting a broader set of technical skills to match evolving demands.
