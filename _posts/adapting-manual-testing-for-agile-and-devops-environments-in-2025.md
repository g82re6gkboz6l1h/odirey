## Manual Testing in Agile and DevOps: A Perfect Blend

### Manual Testing in Agile Workflows
Agile development emphasizes delivering incremental value through sprints, where manual testing proves indispensable in usability assessments, exploratory testing, and ensuring feature compatibility. In integrated Agile workflows:
- Manual testing is embedded in sprint planning and backlog grooming.
- Testers actively collaborate on story refinement and acceptance criteria creation.

### Manual Testing’s Role in DevOps Pipelines
While DevOps emphasizes automation and speed, manual testing remains crucial in staging and pre-production phases. Testers add value by:
- Validating complex flows overlooked by automation.
- Offering qualitative feedback during staging.
Automation tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) enhance manual efforts by streamlining workflows.
