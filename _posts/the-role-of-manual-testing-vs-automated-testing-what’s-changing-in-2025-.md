## Evolution of Manual and Automated Testing

Manual testing has long been a flexible and intuitive approach, especially in identifying UX issues, design inconsistencies, or edge cases. However, automation gained traction for its speed and ability to execute complex tasks reliably through tools like Selenium or JUnit.

As software requirements grow in complexity, both methods face new demands. Modern advancements in AI and machine learning are breaking traditional boundaries. Tools like Zof AI integrate manual expertise with the efficiency of automation, revolutionizing the testing space.
