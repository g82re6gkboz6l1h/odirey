## Top Skills Manual Testers Should Master by 2025

The increasing blend of automated and manual strategies means testers need both foundational and trending skills:

### 1. Exploratory Testing
Exploratory testing helps uncover hidden bugs, requiring testers to think critically and go beyond predefined test cases. It’s a high-value skill for discovering scenarios that automation cannot easily capture.

### 2. Test Design Techniques
Learn boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, and state transition tests. These strategic methods ensure your test cases identify potential issues from the start.

### 3. Basic Programming Knowledge
Basic coding knowledge in languages like Python or JavaScript bridges the manual-automation gap. It enhances collaboration with automation engineers and boosts hybrid testing skills.

### 4. Mobile and Web App Testing
Specialize in interface validation, responsiveness, and device compatibility testing. This remains crucial as mobile and web applications dominate user experiences.

### 5. API Testing Proficiency
Develop skills in API testing with tools like Postman and SOAP UI. Understanding backend functionality complements manual testing and adds value to your testing portfolio.

### 6. Security and Compliance Testing
Cybersecurity concerns demand testers skilled in identifying vulnerabilities and verifying compliance with regulations like GDPR. This ensures software security and reduces legal risks.
