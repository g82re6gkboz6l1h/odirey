## What is Manual Testing and Why is it Important?

Manual testing involves testers executing test cases to evaluate usability, detect bugs, and ensure the software meets requirements. Key benefits include:

- **Human Insight** for UX/UI evaluations.
- **Flexibility** in exploratory and ad-hoc testing.
- **Ideal for Complex Scenarios** such as hardware-software integrations.
- **Cost-Effectiveness** for startups and smaller projects.

Learn why this hands-on approach remains critical in quality assurance.
