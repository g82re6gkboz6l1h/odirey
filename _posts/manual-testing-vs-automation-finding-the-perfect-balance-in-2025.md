## Using Manual Testing and Automation Smartly in QA

### What Manual Testing Brings: Human-Driven Precision

Manual testing allows skilled QA professionals to evaluate a software’s usability, adaptability, and real-world performance. Unlike automated tools, humans can uncover subtle user experience issues and edge cases that improve overall satisfaction.

### Automated Testing's Efficiency: Fast, Scalable Accuracy

Automation testing handles repetitive tasks like load testing and regression testing efficiently. These tests scale well, minimize human error, and allow more extensive test coverage with advanced AI-based solutions revolutionizing speed and accuracy.
