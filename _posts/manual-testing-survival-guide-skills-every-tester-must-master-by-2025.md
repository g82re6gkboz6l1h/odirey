## The Importance of Manual Testing in a Tech-Driven Era

While automated testing tools like Selenium or Appium are gaining prominence, manual testing retains its value in assessing usability, aesthetics, and human-oriented aspects. Automation excels at repetitive tasks and data analysis but struggles to capture unique insights such as accessibility or user intuition. Manual testing complements automation, ensuring software aligns with end-user expectations—a role that will remain vital as systems become increasingly complex by 2025.
