## Why Does Manual Testing Matter in 2025?

Even with the automation revolution, manual testing holds its ground due to its versatility and unique benefits:

1. **Human Creativity**: Certain user-centric elements require the intuition only humans can provide, especially in UI/UX testing.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Manual testers excel in uncovering unanticipated bugs through dynamic application exploration.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Manual testing proves ideal for small-scale projects or environments with minimal recurring tests.
4. **Agile Adaptability**: In rapidly changing development pipelines, manual testers ensure immediate feedback while automation gets set up.
