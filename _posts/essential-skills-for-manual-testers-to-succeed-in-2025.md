## The Changing Role of Manual Testing

Gone are the days when manual testing meant clicking through software and reporting bugs. With advanced AI tools, robust APIs, and cloud-based platforms becoming mainstream, today’s testing professionals must possess a diverse skillset. This evolution doesn’t eradicate the need for manual testing but enhances its value through integration with new technologies.

By 2025, manual testers are expected to:

- Work seamlessly with AI-driven platforms to optimize test coverage and defect identification.
- Adapt to iterative delivery models like Agile and DevOps, collaborating effectively across teams.
- Acquire foundational knowledge of automation tools to supplement their manual testing skills.
