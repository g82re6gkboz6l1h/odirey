## The Role of Manual Testing in the Age of AI

AI offers enhanced speed, efficiency, and accuracy, but manual testing retains its value for human-centric scenarios and usability assessments. Here’s an overview:

### Key Changes AI Brings to Testing:
- **Automated Exploratory Testing**: AI identifies risks, patterns, and anomalies, performing tasks previously reliant on manual testers.
- **Decision Process Automation**: Predictive analytics and machine learning prioritize bugs.
- **Focus on Validation**: Manual testing shifts to areas like usability, accessibility, and design verification.

**The Verdict:** Manual testing isn’t obsolete; it adapts to complement AI workflows with human expertise.
