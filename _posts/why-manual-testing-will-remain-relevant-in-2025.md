## The Truth About Manual Testing: Dispelling Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: Automation Can Handle Everything
Automation excels in repetitive and scalable tasks, such as functional or regression testing. Yet, it struggles with nuanced areas like design consistency, usability, and user empathy—elements requiring human insight.

### Myth 2: AI Is Enough to Replace Human Intuition
AI tools like Zof AI ([Zof.ai](https://zof.ai)) analyze vast datasets and identify bugs but lack contextual understanding. Intuition and creativity remain essential for user experience evaluation and cultural nuances.

### Myth 3: Manual Testing Is Inefficient
While slower in some instances, manual testing is invaluable for exploratory testing, detecting edge cases, and unforeseen user behaviors not covered in automated scripts.
