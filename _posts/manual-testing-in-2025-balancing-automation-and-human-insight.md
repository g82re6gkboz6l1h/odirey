Case Studies: Manual Testing Triumphs

### UX Flaw Discovery in Mobile Updates
Automated test suites missed usability errors in a major app overhaul, caught only through manual user experience testing.

### AI Model Correction
Healthcare application testers identified demographic exclusions in AI predictions, refining algorithm fairness that automation failed to catch.

### Cultural Localization for SaaS
Manual testers uncovered linguistic mistakes with cultural subtleties, ensuring accuracy in international markets.

These cases reinforce manual testing's depth, ensuring not only technical correctness but user-centric success.
