## How Manual Testing Adapts to the AI Age

AI and automation have reshaped software testing, introducing tools like predictive models and self-healing frameworks. Yet, manual testing excels in areas where human intuition is indispensable.

### Key Transformations in Manual Testing:
1. **Strategic Exploratory and Usability Testing**: While automation detects mechanical failures, manual testers focus on spotting user experience issues and unpredictable bugs.
2. **Collaboration with Automation Frameworks**: Tools like AI handle repetitive tasks, empowering testers to prioritize tasks like edge-case design and system behavior reviews.
3. **Data-Informed Decisions**: Leveraging analytics from automation tools, testers target high-priority and failure-prone areas intelligently.

AI and manual testing work best as an integrated system, enhancing agility and efficiency.
