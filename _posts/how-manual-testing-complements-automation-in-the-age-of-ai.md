## The Role of Manual and Automated Testing in 2025

Automation has redefined software testing, excelling in scalability and predictability. However, manual testing remains crucial for:
- Exploratory testing requiring creativity
- UX and accessibility evaluations
- Handling unscripted, real-world scenarios
- Domain-specific assessments beyond predefined scripts.

AI advancements, including tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai), empower manual testers by assisting in test case generation, anomaly detection, and efficiency boosts, creating a perfect harmony between automated and human-driven approaches.
