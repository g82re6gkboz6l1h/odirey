## Why Manual Testing is Crucial Today

Although automation handles repetitive tasks efficiently, manual testing is essential for complex challenges:

1. **Unscripted Explorations**: Gain insights into unpredictable user behaviors and detect subtle flaws automation might miss.
2. **UX Evaluation**: Assess user experience intuitively for smooth workflows and improved design.
3. **Edge Case Analysis**: Explore rare, unexpected scenarios beyond predefined automation scripts.
4. **Tech Adaptability**: Human testers easily adapt to AI, blockchain, augmented reality (AR), and other evolving technologies.
