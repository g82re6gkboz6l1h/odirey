## Challenges Manual Testers Will Face in 2025

Here are the notable challenges manual testers will encounter in 2025:

### 1. **Complex Software Systems**
As technologies like AI, IoT, machine learning, and blockchain evolve, manual testers must address high levels of system complexity and interconnected workflows.

### 2. **Shorter Development Cycles**
Agile and DevOps methodologies demand shorter development and QA cycles, placing immense pressure on manual testers to deliver results under time constraints.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
With users accessing software across desktops, smartphones, wearables, and IoT devices, manual testers face a heavy burden to ensure compatibility for diverse environments.

### 4. **Integration with AI and Automation**
While AI offers improved testing efficiencies, many testers fear automation could replace manual processes. Learning to collaborate with AI tools is critical.

### 5. **Constant Technological Changes**
With fast-paced innovation, manual testers must regularly update their skills to address new frameworks, methodologies, and technologies.
