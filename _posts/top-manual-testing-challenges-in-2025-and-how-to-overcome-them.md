## Top Manual Testing Challenges in 2025

As the industry evolves, manual testers will encounter specific hurdles that demand innovative solutions:

1. **Greater Software Complexity**
   With interconnected applications, microservices, and third-party integrations expanding, testers face difficulties managing variables across configurations and platforms.

2. **Shortened Agile Timelines**
   Continuous delivery models necessitate rapid testing cycles, creating pressure for teams to deliver quality within restricted timeframes.

3. **Adoption of Emerging Technologies**
   Technologies like AI, IoT, blockchain, and AR/VR pose unique challenges for manual testing frameworks and expertise.

4. **Collaboration Barriers in Agile**
   Poor communication and redundancy within agile teams can hinder successful collaboration between testers and developers.

5. **Limited Resources**
   Budget limitations push testers to maintain quality with fewer resources. Combining creativity and efficiency becomes central to addressing these constraints.
