## The Evolving Role of Manual Testing in Agile Development

Modern agile workflows demand adaptability, collaboration, and fast delivery. Manual testing adapts to these needs by becoming increasingly analytical, focusing on creating testing strategies that align with development goals. 

Manual testers play crucial roles within agile teams, bridging the gap between automation scripts and real-world user behavior. By 2025, their focus will include areas automation struggles to cover, such as:

- Evaluating user experience, design, and functionality.
- Testing accessibility for diverse user bases.
- Verifying human-centric workflows.
- Assessing emotional and logical application consistency.

Manual testers ensure end-users enjoy seamless and intuitive experiences, solidifying their value alongside automation.
