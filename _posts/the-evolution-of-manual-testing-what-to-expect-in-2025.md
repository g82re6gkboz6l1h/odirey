## What’s Changing in Manual Testing? Key Trends to Watch

Manual testing has traditionally relied on human intuition, attention to detail, and analytical abilities for identifying issues in software systems. However, as organizations embrace Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) models and highly complex architectures, manual testing's role has expanded beyond bug detection to quality orchestration within tech teams. AI advancements have introduced smarter, faster tools that streamline repetitive tasks, leaving manual testers more bandwidth to address exploratory testing, edge cases, and user-centric evaluations.
