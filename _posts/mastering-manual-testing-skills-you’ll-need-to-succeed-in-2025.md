## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in the Era of Automation

Despite rapid advancements in automation, manual testing brings critical value to software quality assurance. Here’s why it’s irreplaceable:

1. **Real-World User Simulation**: Manual testers understand user behavior and uncover usability issues that automated scripts can’t identify.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Unlike automation, manual testing adapts on-the-go to uncover hidden defects.
3. **Complex Edge Cases**: Unique corner cases and subtle bugs often elude automated testing tools.
4. **UI/UX Validation**: Human testers detect inconsistencies in design and navigation that enhance user experience.
