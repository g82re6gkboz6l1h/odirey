## **Why Human Testers Will Always Matter**

AI tools are brilliant but limited to structured datasets and algorithms. Only humans can:

- Assess emotional responses to software.
- Adapt to unpredictable, unscripted scenarios.
- Understand cultural nuances and overall product vision.
- Conduct exploratory testing driven by curiosity.

By integrating both testing approaches, QA teams enhance user experiences and deliver exceptional results.
