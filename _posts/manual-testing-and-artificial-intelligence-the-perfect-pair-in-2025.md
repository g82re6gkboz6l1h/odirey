## What Is the Role of AI in Software Testing?

Manual testing relies on human expertise, creativity, and intuition to identify bugs or inefficiencies in software applications. While thorough, it is prone to human error and inefficiencies when applied to high-volume or repetitive tasks.

AI introduces speed, data-driven accuracy, and predictive capabilities into software testing. It automates routine and repetitive tasks, improves test case generation, and predicts potential software failures. However, the purpose of AI is not to replace manual testers but to amplify their capabilities for a more strategic, comprehensive QA process.

Leading the way in AI-powered testing, [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) offers innovative tools that enhance and streamline the manual testing experience, enabling QA teams to deliver top-notch software products.
