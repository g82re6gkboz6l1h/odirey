## The Complete Lifecycle of Manual Testing

Manual testing isn’t just running test cases—it’s a systematic process spanning key phases:

### 1. Requirement Analysis
Deeply understand project goals, collaborate with stakeholders, and create clear test plans based on detailed requirements.

### 2. Test Planning
Strategize and prioritize test cases through risk assessments while establishing timelines and assigning resources effectively.

### 3. Test Case Design
Develop and document structured test cases that address functional requirements, edge cases, and negative tests.

### 4. Test Execution
Perform tests in real-world scenarios to evaluate software performance and user experience.

### 5. Defect Reporting
Maintain detailed defect logs, complete with reproduction steps, screenshots, and severity analysis.

### 6. Regression Testing
After bug fixes or updates, retest software to confirm the stability of existing features.

### 7. Test Closure
Finalize testing reports and share insights to improve future processes.

Understanding this lifecycle ensures optimization of every testing phase, minimizing inefficiencies and enhancing accuracy.
