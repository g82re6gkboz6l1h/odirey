## What is Manual Testing?

**Manual testing** entails verifying software functionality through human intervention without relying on automated testing tools. Unlike automation, manual testing allows the tester to simulate real user interactions and behaviors, helping identify user-centric issues like usability, design flaws, and user flow.

Manual testing is critical for applications emphasizing **usability**, where human judgment ensures the value of the user experience. Automated tests may miss nuanced bugs that occur due to human behavior or intricate UI paths.

## Why Manual Testing is Still Crucial in the SDLC

Despite continued innovations in automation, manual testing fills pivotal roles in specific testing scenarios. Here are some reasons why manual testing stands out:

### 1. **Usability Testing**
Human insights offer unparalleled value in determining whether an application is easy and effective for end users. 

### 2. **Exploratory Testing**
Manual testers use creativity and intuition to identify edge cases outside of any predefined scripts.

### 3. **Ad hoc Testing**
Quickly diagnosing and resolving unplanned bugs requires a human brain's flexibility and creativity.

### 4. **Regression Testing**
While automating regression tests helps cover repetitive tasks, manual testing can catch the subtle or context-sensitive defects that automation may miss.
