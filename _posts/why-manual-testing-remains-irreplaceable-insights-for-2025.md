## Automation vs. Manual Testing: Myths Debunked

Automation testing is rapid and precise but cannot fully replace manual testing. Here’s why manual testing is irreplaceable:

1. **Empathy and User Experience**: Manual testers bring human intuition to test from the user’s perspective. Machines can’t assess subjective usability, like clunky navigation or confusing workflows.
   
2. **Unscripted Exploration**: Automation follows predefined scripts, but manual testing excels in dynamic, unscripted scenarios where unexpected bugs often emerge.
   
3. **Edge Cases**: Complex systems like healthcare apps or games depend on human judgment for detecting nuanced errors.

4. **Cost Effectiveness**: Automation can be expensive initially, making manual testing ideal for startups or smaller projects with limited budgets.

When combined, manual and automated testing create a robust QA strategy that balances efficiency with human creativity.
