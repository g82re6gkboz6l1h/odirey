## Emerging Manual Testing Strategies for 2025

### 1. **Context-Driven Testing**
Tailored approaches are key to addressing project-specific variables. Context-driven testing adapts strategies to align with unique requirements, making it ideal for industries with rapid change cycles.

### 2. **Exploratory Testing**
This interactive methodology lets testers design and assess test cases in real time, uncovering usability flaws and vulnerabilities during iterative development cycles.

### 3. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
BDD improves collaboration among developers, testers, and stakeholders by creating human-readable test cases focused on user behavior, ensuring clarity and alignment.

### 4. **Risk-Based Testing**
Focusing testing resources on high-risk components ensures optimal coverage and highlights vulnerabilities that have the greatest impact on software performance.

### 5. **Agile and DevOps Integration**
Manual testers play a critical role in Agile and DevOps environments with context-aware feedback. This approach keeps the focus on end-user satisfaction amid constant integration cycles.
