## Why Manual Testers Are Still Relevant in 2025

The shift toward automated testing is undeniable, with tools taking over repetitive tasks like regression testing and load simulations. Platforms like **Zof AI** are excelling in intelligent test automation, but software ultimately serves humans—not machines. Manual testers bring empathy and context-awareness, ensuring a user-centric approach.

Key areas where manual testers excel include:

- **Exploratory Testing:** Discovering edge cases automation might bypass.
- **User-Centric Validation:** Ensuring software meets real-world user needs.
- **Ethics and Bias-Free AI:** Addressing ethical concerns in AI systems.
