## The Changing Landscape of Manual Testing

Manual testing processes have progressed significantly. Traditionally focused on identifying bugs by simulating user behavior, manual testing is now integrated with automation systems to improve accuracy and shorten testing cycles. With the introduction of hybrid testing models, manual testing is no longer isolated but works symbiotically with automated and AI-powered approaches.

Modern QA teams emphasize workflows that prioritize adaptability over rigid, scripted test cases. Testers are now critical players in the development process, contributing insights that enhance product quality and align with business goals.
