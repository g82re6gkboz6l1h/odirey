## Introduction to Manual Testing and Its Future in 2025

Manual testing, distinct from automation, uses human intuition and creativity to explore software, mimicking user behaviors to discover hidden gaps. 

As technology advances, manual testing stays relevant in usability, exploratory testing, and assessing complex interactions. Product categories like gaming, e-commerce, and healthcare software demand human-led testing to ensure user satisfaction. Furthermore, testing AI-driven applications often requires manual intervention for accuracy.

The value of manual testing lies in its ability to provide a human-centered focus, complementing automation tools even as they grow more robust.
