## The Changing Landscape of Manual Testing

Traditional manual testing has transformed significantly, shaped by methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and CI/CD. Automation testing has addressed repetitive tasks, but manual testing excels at identifying subtle issues such as UI flaws and user satisfaction challenges. As new technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and IoT expand, the complexity of testing grows too, demanding a refined synergy between human ingenuity and automated tools. Manual testing now complements automation, leveraging the creative and intuitive strengths of human testers.
