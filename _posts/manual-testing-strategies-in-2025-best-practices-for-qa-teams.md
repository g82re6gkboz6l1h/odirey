## Why Manual Testing Still Matters

As software development evolves, it becomes evident that automation alone can't address every QA challenge. Manual testing ensures that usability, accessibility, and overall user experience are thoroughly examined. In 2025, QA teams recognize manual testing not as a competitor to automation but as a critical ally, especially in:

- **Usability and exploratory testing**: Capturing subtle user experience nuances.
- **Diverse device ecosystems**: Ensuring compatibility across IoT, AR/VR, and other emerging platforms.
- **AI fairness**: Detecting bias in AI-driven functionalities to enhance inclusiveness.

By integrating workflows that balance automation and manual testing, QA teams deliver optimal results tailored to human expectations.
