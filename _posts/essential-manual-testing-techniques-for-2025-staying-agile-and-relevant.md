## Manual Testing in Software Quality Assurance: Why Agile Needs the Human Touch

Agile development prioritizes flexibility, continuous delivery, and iterative improvements. Manual testing complements automation by addressing creative processes where machine logic falls short.

### Key Benefits of Manual Testing in Agile:
1. **Exploratory Testing** discovers edge cases and usability problems.
2. **Adapting Quickly** to constant changes during development cycles.
3. **Human Perspective** for evaluating visual design, accessibility, and user experience.

In agile workflows, manual testing bridges the gap between automated efficiency and human creativity, enabling precise software delivery.
