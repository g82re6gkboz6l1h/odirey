## Why Manual Testing Still Holds Its Ground

Automation has transformed software testing, but manual testing continues to shine brightly, especially for:

1. **Human-Centric Validation**: Machines can detect bugs but often miss intuitive user experiences—manual testers excel in identifying accessibility and emotional resonance.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Creativity matters. Testers uncover issues in unscripted interactions that automation might miss.
3. **Cost-Effective for Startups**: Smaller-scale applications benefit from manual testing without the high setup costs of automated frameworks.
4. **Complex Scenarios**: Edge cases and intricate workflows often need human insights for effective testing.
5. **Empathy and Accessibility**: Inclusivity is a priority—manual testing ensures applications serve differently-abled users effectively.
