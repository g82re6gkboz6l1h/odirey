## Why Software Teams Need Both Manual and Automated Testing

### Manual Testing: Insights Beyond Automation
Manual testing involves human testers replicating user interactions step-by-step, making it especially vital for exploratory and usability testing. This intuitive approach excels at uncovering hidden issues and assessing user experience.

### Automated Testing: Efficiency, Speed, and Scalability
Automated testing operates with scripts and tools, offering faster execution for repetitive, high-volume tasks. Best suited for regression and performance testing, automation brings precision and expands coverage across environments.
