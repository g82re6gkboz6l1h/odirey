## Unlocking the Basics: What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing is a hands-on approach where QA testers execute test cases manually without the assistance of automated scripts or tools. It requires human intelligence, creativity, and attention to detail to simulate end-user behaviors effectively. By analyzing software features and identifying bugs, manual testing plays a pivotal role in confirming usability and functionality under real-world conditions.

### Why Manual Testing Matters in QA:
- **Explores Edge Cases:** Unlike automated tools, manual testing reveals unique or unanticipated user scenarios.
- **Validates User Experience:** Manual testers gauge usability issues tools can’t replicate.
- **Ensures Accessibility:** Testers assess features for users with disabilities.
- **Handles Complex Scenarios:** Useful for applications with dynamic requirements.

## 10 Must-Know Manual Testing Techniques for QA Experts

### 1. **Exploratory Testing**
Dive into the software without predefined test cases, relying on creativity to uncover hidden bugs and edge cases.

### 2. **Ad-Hoc Testing**
Conduct random tests without planning to identify overlooked issues, complementing exploratory testing.

### 3. **Negative Testing**
Test invalid or incorrect inputs to ensure the system handles errors gracefully.

### 4. **Smoke Testing**
Perform initial tests to verify whether the core functionality is intact, acting as a build verification checkpoint.

### 5. **Regression Testing**
Recheck stable functionalities after every update to ensure no changes have caused disruption.

### 6. **Compatibility Testing**
Validate your application across various hardware, browsers, devices, and operating systems for optimized user experience.

### 7. **Usability Testing**
Examine the interface, navigation, and overall user experience to ensure intuitiveness and satisfaction.

### 8. **Boundary Value Testing**
Test input ranges by entering values at the edges to detect system responses.

### 9. **Integration Testing**
Assess how seamlessly individual components or modules work as a whole.

### 10. **Acceptance Testing**
Ensure the final product meets predefined requirements and is ready for deployment.
