## Understanding the Relevance of Manual Testing

Is manual testing obsolete with automation advancements? The answer is an emphatic no. Automation testing can execute pre-defined scripts and manage repetitive tasks at scale. Yet, it falls short in areas demanding adaptability, creativity, and context—qualities unique to human testers. Manual testing brings value by addressing **user experience**, **accessibility**, and **design nuances** that automated tools can't fully grasp.

Exploratory testing, which requires intuition and critical thinking to uncover edge cases, thrives under manual efforts. Industries like healthcare, finance, and aerospace, where software systems are mission-critical, depend on the depth and empirical judgment of manual testing for seamless QA.
