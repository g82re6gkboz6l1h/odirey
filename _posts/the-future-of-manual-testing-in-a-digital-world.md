## Exploring Manual Testing and Its Enduring Importance

Manual testing involves QA professionals executing test cases without the support of automated tools, simulating user interactions to identify flaws related to functionality, UX, and interface design. This human-driven approach is a cornerstone of early-stage development, empowering teams to explore complex scenarios and unearth nuanced defects that automation might bypass. The role of manual testing becomes even more critical as software applications diversify, meeting varied user needs in dynamic environments.
