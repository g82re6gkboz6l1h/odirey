## Manual Testing and Exploratory Testing: A Dynamic Duo

### The Importance of Exploratory Testing in 2025
Automated tests cannot identify context-specific issues or edge cases. Exploratory testing addresses these challenges using human intuition. 

### Structured Exploratory Testing Practices for QA
- **Create Clear Testing Charters**: Focus on specific objectives to improve results. 
- **Thorough Documentation**: Use tools like Zof AI to log exploratory findings effectively.
- **Collaborate with Teams**: Share exploratory insights for enhanced test design.
