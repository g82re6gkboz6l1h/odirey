## The Growing Role of AI in Manual Testing

Traditionally, manual testing provided vital human insights that automation couldn’t replicate. However, with the rise of AI, repetitive and time-consuming tasks like regression and functional testing are increasingly automated. Rather than replacing human testers, AI tools complement their work, enabling them to focus on complex areas like exploratory and usability testing.

This hybrid approach of combining human expertise with AI’s analytical power is redefining how manual testing is performed in 2025.
