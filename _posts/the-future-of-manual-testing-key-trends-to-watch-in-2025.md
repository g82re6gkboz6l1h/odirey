## Why Manual Testing Remains Vital

Manual testing is critical for ensuring software meets functional and emotional user expectations, addressing areas like usability evaluation, exploratory testing, and out-of-the-box problem-solving. Unlike automation that follows preset scripts, manual testers emulate human behaviors and detect unpredictable issues, making them indispensable in delivering high-quality software experiences.
