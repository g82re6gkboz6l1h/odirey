## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in a Tech-Forward World

Manual testing remains crucial for addressing user-centric, ethical, and unpredictable scenarios. While automation excels in repetitive and scalable tasks, challenges requiring creativity, intuition, and contextual understanding are best managed by human testers. By embracing AI as a collaborator, manual testers create a dynamic partnership where efficiency and empathy meet.
