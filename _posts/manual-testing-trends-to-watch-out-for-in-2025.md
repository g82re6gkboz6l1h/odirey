## Manual Testing: Its Evolving Role in Software QA

Manual testing involves verifying application functionality through human interaction without automation tools. While repetitive tasks can be handled efficiently through automation, manual testing is indispensable for:

- **Exploratory Testing**: Where scripts cannot predict unique human behaviors.
- **Usability Testing**: Validating user experiences based on real perception.
- **Human Judgment in Subjective Testing**: Where emotional and contextual validation is required.

### The Shift in Manual Testing Expectations

Emerging complexities in software systems, hyper-personalized interfaces, AI-powered systems, blockchain ecosystems, and IoT devices are changing the scope of manual testing in 2025. Manual testers will expand their expertise to address evolving software landscapes and adapt their skills accordingly.
