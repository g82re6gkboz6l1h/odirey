## Challenges Faced by Manual Testers

Manual testing ensures software runs smoothly, but it comes with hurdles:

1. **Time-Intensive**: Tasks like validating functionalities are slow and prone to unforeseen delays.
2. **Susceptibility to Errors**: Fatigue-induced mistakes can complicate development cycles.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Growing applications demand extensive testing beyond human capacity.
4. **Lack of Predictive Tools**: Traditional methods don’t provide actionable predictive insights, delaying proactive resolutions.

These persistent roadblocks make an AI-driven solution, like Zof AI, essential for enhanced productivity.
