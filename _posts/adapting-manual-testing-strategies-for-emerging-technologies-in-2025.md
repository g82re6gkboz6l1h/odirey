## How Emerging Technologies are Shaping Modern Testing Requirements

Testing in 2025 goes beyond traditional web and mobile apps. Advancements in cutting-edge technologies demand that manual testers stay ahead to tackle the challenges posed by next-gen systems. The emerging technologies reshaping testing priorities include:

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Systems**  
   AI introduces dynamic learning, adaptive algorithms, and complex decision-making that evolve over time. Testing such systems involves understanding AI behavior, spotting bias, and validating data integrity.

2. **Blockchain and Decentralized Applications (dApps)**  
   Blockchain’s distributed nature calls for unique test procedures to evaluate transparency, data verification, and token-based interactions for compliance.

3. **Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR)**  
   Immersive applications rely on human sensory interaction. Manual testers play a key role in validating user experience, accessibility, and interactive design in three-dimensional environments.

4. **Internet of Things (IoT)**  
   IoT’s interconnected smart devices require comprehensive testing for hardware compatibility, network variability, and unique scenarios involving real-time data and user interactions.

5. **Autonomous Systems**  
   Self-driving cars, drones, and robots rely on a combination of AI, hardware, and real-world data. Manual testing must replicate real-world variables to ensure reliability, safety, and ethical compliance.

These emerging fields require innovative testing frameworks to cater to their distinct challenges.

## Key Challenges in Manual Testing of Advanced Applications

As manual testing proves its value for human-centric and qualitative analysis, emerging technologies introduce complexities necessitating a shift in traditional testing approaches.

### 1. **System Complexity**  
Next-gen platforms like blockchain and AI are inherently complicated. For example, AI’s performance depends on training data and model biases, requiring testers to verify its fairness. Blockchain’s decentralized setup complicates testing for end-to-end transactions and data accuracy.

### 2. **High Variability**  
Emerging tech increases test permutations. IoT, for instance, demands coverage across endless hardware configurations and network environments, escalating the effort for testers.

### 3. **New and Undefined Use Cases**  
Many innovations lack standardization. Manual testers must often build custom scenarios from scratch to address unique behaviors in nascent technologies.

### 4. **Complex Human Interactions**  
Automation struggles where human experience is essential, such as in VR/AR user interactions or AI-driven systems. Manual testing remains essential for such qualitative assessments.

### 5. **Real-world Environment Testing**  
Validating autonomous systems requires replicating unpredictable real-world environments. Testing for scenarios like adverse weather, GPS issues, or human intervention is critical.

Although these challenges are formidable, integrating advanced tools and innovative strategies into manual testing can help testers meet these demands effectively.
