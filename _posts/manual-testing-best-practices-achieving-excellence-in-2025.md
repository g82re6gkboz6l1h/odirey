## Why Manual Testing Is Key in Today's AI-Driven Era

While AI accelerates testing speed, accuracy, and scalability, it cannot replicate the human ability to adapt, intuit, and assess real-world applications. Here’s why manual testing remains crucial:

- **Exploratory Testing:** Human testers excel at uncovering nuanced issues through exploration, identifying edge cases that AI might overlook.
- **Usability Testing:** Manual testers can evaluate UI/UX intuitively, ensuring accessibility and delighting users.
- **Complex Scenarios:** Unlike automation, a human touch can dynamically adapt to complex logic and unpredictable situations.
- **Post-Automation Validation:** Manual testing ensures that automation tools work effectively and align with project goals.

Manual testing and AI together form a synergistic approach, strengthening testing processes holistically.
