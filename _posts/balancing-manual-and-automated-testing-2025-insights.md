## Advantages and Challenges of Manual and Automated Testing

### The Value of Manual Testing
Manual testing remains essential for scenarios requiring intuition and subjectivity, including exploratory or usability testing. However, in 2025, it presents challenges like scalability limitations, human error risks, and time-intensive processes. Despite these hurdles, manual testing excels in UI assessments, adaptability to change, and nuanced critical analysis.

### Benefits of Automated Testing
Automated testing shines in efficiency, scalability, and repeatability, thriving in areas like regression and performance testing. However, the upfront investment, maintenance requirements, and inability to handle subjective analysis make it incomplete on its own.

### Achieving Balance with Hybrid Approaches
Combining manual and automated testing ensures optimal testing scope and efficiency. Learn how allocating tasks strategically between the two methodologies drives better results.
