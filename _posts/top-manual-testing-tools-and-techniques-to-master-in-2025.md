## Why Manual Testing is More Relevant Than Ever in 2025

Automation might promise speed and scale, but manual testing holds irreplaceable value when dealing with human-centric issues. Here’s why manual testing is not going anywhere:

1. **Unmatched Human Insight**: Capture usability flaws, evaluate emotional design, and ensure seamless navigation.
2. **Test Critical Edge Cases**: Evaluate unique real-world scenarios, like intermittent connection errors or unexpected inputs.
3. **Validate New Features**: Perform exploratory testing for verifying added functionalities and identifying potential flaws.
4. **Spot Ethical Issues**: Where automation can inadvertently validate biases, manual testers ensure fairness and inclusivity in applications.
