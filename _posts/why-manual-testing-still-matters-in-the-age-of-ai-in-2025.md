## Manual Testing vs Automated Testing: Debunking Misconceptions

### Myth 1: Automated Testing Covers Every Scenario
Automated testing shines in areas like regression testing and scalability but falls short in tasks demanding nuanced human understanding—such as exploratory testing and usability analysis.

### Myth 2: Manual Testing is Obsolete
Far from outdated, manual testing thrives in identifying contextual errors, user behavior anomalies, and issues missed by automation.
