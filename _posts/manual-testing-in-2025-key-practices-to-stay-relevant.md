## Why Manual Testing Remains Essential in an Era of Automation

Automation has transformed QA with its speed and efficiency, but manual testing is still indispensable. Scenarios like exploratory testing, usability evaluation, and dealing with dynamic, unpredictable applications require human intervention. Manual testers add the critical thinking and creative context that machines can’t replicate. Complementing automation with manual expertise ensures a more holistic QA strategy and better results.
