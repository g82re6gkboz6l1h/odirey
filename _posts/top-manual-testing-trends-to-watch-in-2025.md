## Evolution of Manual Testing to Meet Modern Challenges

Manual testing has long been regarded as the cornerstone of software quality assurance, yet its role is changing progressively. In tandem with Agile and DevOps, manual testing has pivoted toward flexible exploratory methods over rigid templates, allowing testers to simulate real-world user experiences more effectively.

Contrary to popular assumptions, manual and automated testing aren't adversarial—they're complementary. Automation handles repetitive processes like regression testing, while manual testing delves into creative, dynamic facets such as user interactions, accessibility validations, and edge cases. As AI technologies evolve, manual testers are anticipated to adapt seamlessly to hybrid efforts that embody both automation and human ingenuity.
