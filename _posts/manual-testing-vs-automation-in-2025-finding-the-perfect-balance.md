## Why Manual Testing Still Matters in 2025

Manual testing involves direct human interaction to evaluate software functionality and usability. Despite automation's dominance, manual testing continues to serve unique roles.

### **Key Benefits of Manual Testing**
1. **Human-Centric Evaluation**: Areas like usability and accessibility demand human judgment for comprehensive testing.
2. **Exploratory Testing**: Unpredictable scenarios and unstructured bug discovery thrive under manual exploration.
3. **Adaptability**: Manual testing flexes to immediate needs in dynamic projects or changes.

### **Challenges of Manual Testing**
1. **Time Constraints**: High-volume testing consumes significant time.
2. **Human Errors**: Fatigue and bias may affect reliability.
3. **Scalability Limitation**: Complex systems require automation for broad coverage.
