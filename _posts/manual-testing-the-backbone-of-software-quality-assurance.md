## What is Manual Testing?

**Manual testing** is a process in which testers manually execute test cases without automated tools to identify bugs, errors, or usability issues in software applications. This approach heavily relies on human intuition and reasoning to simulate real-world scenarios, detect complex errors, and ensure an optimal user experience.

### Core Features of Manual Testing:
1. **Human-Centric**: Real user interaction to observe and validate software behavior.
2. **Exploratory and Adaptive**: Enables testing for unexpected flaws and adjusting test cases on the go.
3. **Diverse Testing Approaches**: Includes functional testing, usability testing, exploratory testing, and user acceptance testing.

Pros and Cons of Manual Testing

### Advantages of Manual Testing:
1. **Creativity in Problem-Solving**: Human testers excel in thinking creatively, crucial for exploratory testing.
2. **Adaptability**: Unlike automation, manual testing is flexible to last-minute changes in features or design.
3. **Usability Checks**: Human instincts assess factors like readability, UI design, and accessibility better than automation.
4. **Lower Cost for Small Projects**: Manual testing avoids initial high-cost automation setup for small-scale projects.
5. **Quick Setup and Execution**: Requires only basic testing tools for initiation.

### Challenges of Manual Testing:
1. **Time Constraints**: Testing large systems manually can be time-intensive.
2. **Potential for Human Error**: Tester fatigue can lead to overlooked discrepancies, especially for repetitive tasks.
3. **Scalability Limitations**: Unsuitable for extensive regression or performance testing across multiple environments.
4. **Subjectivity**: Different testers may produce inconsistent results.
5. **Limited Test Coverage**: Automated scripts can offer broader, repeated coverage for large systems.
