## Why Manual Testing Matters in the Age of Automation

Despite the rise of automation, manual testing continues to address key aspects of quality assurance, including:

### **1. Simulating Real User Interactions**
Scripts can’t replicate how users naturally interact with software, making manual testers invaluable for understanding usability, navigation, and edge cases.

### **2. Creative Exploratory Testing**
Manual testers excel at uncovering issues by deviating from pre-set scenarios, revealing flaws that scripts miss.

### **3. Visual and UX Testing**
Font alignment, animations, and other design aspects often require human judgment for precise evaluation.

### **4. Contextual Analysis**
Manual testers connect business requirements to user expectations, ensuring software aligns with strategic objectives.
