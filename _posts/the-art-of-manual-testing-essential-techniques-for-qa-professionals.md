## Why Manual Testing is Still Irreplaceable in QA

Manual testing involves human-driven execution of test cases without reliance on automation tools. Despite the rise of automation, manual testing remains crucial for:

- **Human-Centric Validation:** Ensuring software interfaces cater to human users, not machines.
- **Exploratory Insights:** Identifying edge cases and unexpected behaviors automation cannot predict.
- **Dynamic Adaptability:** Quickly accommodating last-minute changes and unstable early-stage code.
- **Creative Problem-Solving:** Exploring software with intuition to unearth hidden vulnerabilities.

Manual testing complements automation, emphasizing human intuition for optimal software performance.
