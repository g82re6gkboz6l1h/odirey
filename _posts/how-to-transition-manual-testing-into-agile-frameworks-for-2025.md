## Adapting Manual Testing for Agile and CI/CD Workflows

Aligning manual testing with Agile requires significant adaptations:
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Collaborate with developers early in the process to address risks.
- **Sprint Participation**: Stay actively involved in planning, standups, and retrospectives.
- **Short Feedback Cycles**: Provide prompt insights to catch defects early.
- **Integrating CI/CD Pipelines**: Validate deployments with exploratory assessments.

Adopt these strategies to contribute effectively within fast-paced Agile teams.
